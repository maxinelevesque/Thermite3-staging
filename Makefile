# Re-derive the WHOLE trust chain on the skeptic's machine (SLOW — minutes):
#   1  the universal faithfulness theorem re-verified by the local Lean kernel
#      (`lake build` from source + `#print axioms` parsed for sorryAx/custom axioms);
#   2  full-corpus translation-validation (every admitted .th — zero Divergent);
#   3  the multi-class falsification battery (the teeth suites Z3 must CATCH) + a
#      visible end-to-end mutant;
#   4  the Rust<->Lean correspondence drift tripwire (pinned SHAs vs current);
#   5  the emitted proof re-verified under third-party Verus (forge excluded);
#   6  the verdict + the honest residual-trust statement.
# Each guarantee-bearing check SKIPs loudly (stating the consequence) when its tool
# is absent, and a SKIP degrades the verdict. Requires elan/lake (check 1) and the
# Verus/Z3 prover (checks 2/3/5: set VERUS_BIN, put `verus` on PATH, or ~/.local/bin/verus).

# certifies L3, the SAME program with an injected bug is REFUSED, and the emitted
# proof re-verifies under third-party Verus with forge excluded. Requires Verus/Z3.

# Doc-drift tripwire (crosslink #258, .design/tooling/doc-drift-tripwire.md):
# FAIL if any routed design doc's governed file contents differ from the doc's
# `audited-content-sha256:` pin; legacy `audited-sha:` pins fall back to a
# full-history commit-set check. The Python tool's own exit code is the contract
# (0 current / 1 drift-or-bad-pin / 3 environment-inconclusive — REQ-9); run it
# directly or via `make doc-drift-worktree` when a script must branch on 1-vs-3,
# because GNU make collapses any nonzero recipe exit to its own code 2. `make
# doc-drift` mirrors pull-request CI by evaluating a synthetic base-first merge
# commit (`DOC_DRIFT_CI_BASE`, default origin/main, merged with
# `DOC_DRIFT_CI_HEAD`, default HEAD) in a temporary worktree. Deliberately NOT
# part of `make audit` — doc freshness is a development-discipline invariant,
# not a link in the proof-trust chain (decision 5); gates/audit.sh stays
# byte-identical.
