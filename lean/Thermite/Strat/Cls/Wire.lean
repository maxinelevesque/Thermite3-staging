  Thermite/Strat/Cls/Wire.lean — the differential battery's Lean entry point
  (`.design/stage2-stratified-cage.md` REQ-4 / AC-4, the M2b classifier differential).

  This module is the LEAN HALF of the stratified-cage classifier differential. The Rust
  classifier (`thermite-spec/src/classifier.rs`) and the SplitMix64 generator
  (`thermite-tv/src/gen.rs`) emit each well-sorted formula in a compact, parenthesized
  S-expression WIRE format; here a `partial` recursive-descent parser turns one wire line
  back into the kernel-defined `Thermite.Strat.Cls.Frm`, and `main` runs the KERNEL
  classifier `Thermite.Strat.Cls.admitted` on it (the exact REQ-3 `admitted`, NOT a
  re-implementation), printing one verdict line per input line. The forge differential
  harness (`forge strat-tv` / `forge/tests/strat_differential.rs`) pipes the generated
  formulas to `lake env lean --run Thermite/Strat/Cls/Wire.lean` on stdin and holds the
  Lean verdicts byte-equal to the Rust ones; any disagreement is a hard CI failure.

  This is a TOOL module (an `IO` driver), not part of the proof spine: it carries no
  theorems and the parser is `partial` (its termination is not needed — a malformed line
  is reported as `parse-error`, never trusted). It is added to the Lean CI build target
  set (`gates/lean-axiom-probe.sh`) only so a compile break is caught, not because it
  contributes an axiom-gated theorem.

  THE WIRE GRAMMAR (tokens are `(`, `)`, and maximal non-paren non-space runs; mirrors
  `thermite-spec/src/classifier.rs`'s `to_wire`/`parse_frm`):
  - sort := `(m WIDTH)` | `(s SORT)` | `(o NAT)`   (WIDTH ∈ u8 u16 u32 u64 usize bool)
  - tm   := `(v SORT INT)` | `(l SORT)` | `(rd SORT TM TM)` | `(ln TM)`
          | `(ct SORT TM)` | `(ix TM INT)` | `(ml TM TM)` | `(a1 SORT SORT NAT TM)`
  - atom := `(r REL TM TM)` | `(qf NAT)`           (REL ∈ eq ne lt le gt ge)
  - frm  := `(at ATOM)` | `(ng FRM)` | `(cj FRM FRM)` | `(dj FRM FRM)`
          | `(im FRM FRM)` | `(al SORT FRM)` | `(ex SORT FRM)`

  A `(qf id)` leaf maps to a distinct closed `Atom.qfree` placeholder. The
  classifier never inspects the payload, but retaining the ID catches wire
  round-trip mistakes and mirrors the production bridge's stable source-leaf
  identity.

    Each parser consumes a `( tag … )` node and returns the value plus the unconsumed
    token suffix, or `none` on a malformed node. `partial` because termination on the
    shrinking token list is not needed for an `IO` tool (a bad line is reported, never
    trusted). -/
