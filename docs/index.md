# Thermite documentation

Thermite is a programming language for AI agents. Every function carries an
enforced contract, every contract clause is checked, and the result ships as a
certificate a third party can re-derive.

- [Overview](overview.md) — the problem Thermite addresses and how the
  assurance ladder works.
- [Language](language.md) — the three contract promises (`!`/`requires`/`ensures`), the
  surface syntax, and how an agent writes a function.
- [Verification](verification.md) — the proof ladder, translation validation,
  and the two proof engines.
- [Trust](trust.md) — what remains trusted, and how `make audit` re-derives the
  rest on your machine.
