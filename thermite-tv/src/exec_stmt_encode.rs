//! The independent operational-semantics reference state-denotation for the frozen
//! straight-line exec-statement subset (`.design/verified/exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-2;
//! epic crosslink #158, blocker #159; `thermite-design.md` §4.1/§6).
//!
//! [`body_ref_state`] maps a straight-line [`Block`] (the frozen 2.2.1 subset:
//! `let`/mutable-`let`/assignment/`if`-as-statement/sequencing/tail/tail-`return`,
//! no loops) to a Verus exec expression string giving the body's final state as a
//! closed-form function of the initial state (the fn params). It is the state
//! analogue of step 2.1's [`crate::exec_encode::exec_ref_value`] (which gives a
//! single value): where 2.1 checks the per-RHS expression value, 2.2.1 adds the
//! orthogonal axis — the state sequencing and mutation-order faithfulness on top of
//! the per-RHS value faithfulness.
//!
//! ## The state-transformer semantics
//!
//! The program state is the environment of in-scope bindings (name -> its current
//! closed-form value expression in the inputs). Big-step evaluation threads an
//! initial environment (the params, each bound to itself) through the statement
//! sequence to a final environment; the body's value is the tail expression
//! evaluated in that final environment. Concretely:
//!
//! - `let [mut] n = <rhs>` binds `n` to the rhs substituted under the current env
//!   (each in-env var replaced by its current value expr). `{ let a = x + 1; let b
//!   = a * 2; b }` -> `a |-> (x + 1)`, then `b |-> ((x + 1) * 2)`, tail `b` ->
//!   `((x + 1) * 2)`.
//! - `n = <rhs>` (assignment / mutation) rebinds the in-scope cell `n` to the rhs
//!   substituted under the current env, order-sensitive: `s = s + 1; s = s * 2`
//!   threads `s |-> x` -> `s |-> (x + 1)` -> `s |-> ((x + 1) * 2)`, but the reorder
//!   `s = s * 2; s = s + 1` threads to `((x * 2) + 1)`, a different closed form
//!   (the state-sequencing check in `exec-stmt-tv.md` AC-3).
//! - `if c { .. } else { .. }` as the body tail composes the two branch
//!   state-transformers into a Verus `if`-expression over the (substituted)
//!   condition — `if c { <then-tail> } else { <else-tail> }` (`exec-stmt-tv.md`
//!   AC-4).
//! - the body's final value is the tail expr (or a tail `return <e>`) evaluated in
//!   the final env. A multi-cell final state is a tuple `(<cell0>, <cell1>, ...)`:
//!   the tail `(a, b)` projects the final `a`/`b` cells (the design's
//!   least-confident #1, grounded by B4).
//!
//! The substitution + threading + branch-composition + tuple projection are the
//! only new logic; every RHS / condition / branch-tail value is encoded by reusing
//! [`crate::exec_encode::exec_ref_value`] on the env-substituted [`Expr`] (the
//! per-RHS bounded-value reference is already independent — it carries the #122
//! inner-paren / #146 cast-`<` / bounded-overflow disciplines). So a value-infidel
//! RHS (the #122/#146/wrong-op class) is also caught by the same body obligation
//! (`exec-stmt-tv.md` AC-5).
//!
//! ## The independence boundary (REQ-2 constraint, R-CHAR-3 / AC-6)
//!
//! This module must not call any `thermite_lower::lower::*` symbol; `thermite-tv`
//! does not depend on `thermite-lower` (`Cargo.toml`; the dep graph makes reuse a
//! compile error). The reference state-denotation is authored from the frozen-subset
//! big-step imperative semantics (`exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-1/REQ-2), not from
//! `lower_block_inner`/`lower_stmt`. Agreement of production's `lower_exec_body` with
//! this reference is N-version differential evidence, not proof.
//!
//! ## Honest boundary (out of the frozen 2.2.1 subset -> an `Err`, never silent-wrong)
//!
//! A construct outside the straight-line subset is an
//! [`crate::exec_encode::RefEncodeError::Unsupported`] (R-CODE-2 / R-APG-1 — never a
//! panic, never a silent wrong denotation): a `Stmt::Loop`/`Break`/`Continue` (step
//! 2.2.2, kernel-gated), a mid-body early `return` nested in an `if` branch (the
//! multi-exit CPS form, out of v1), a `match`-as-statement, a non-scalar mutation
//! (`Vec::push`, a v2 sequence theory), and a re-shadow `let x = ..; let x = ..` in
//! the same block (the flat name->value env can't represent it). A silent wrong
//! denotation would compare a wrong reference.
//!

//! entry (`inv` holds on the pre-loop entry state), preservation (one iteration of the
//! body carries `inv ∧ cond` to `inv`, reusing the shipped [`body_ref_state`] step),
//! and exit (the after-loop state is `inv ∧ ¬cond`-constrained). The after-loop state
//! threads as the design's opaque-but-invariant-constrained fresh cells: a loop cannot
//! produce a closed form (it is a fixpoint), so the post-loop cells are havocked +
//! re-constrained to `inv ∧ ¬cond` (the analogue of how Verus itself models a
//! loop's after-state). Every out-of-v1 loop (`loop`-kind, `break`/`continue`, a
//! mid-body `return`, a nested loop, non-scalar state, a trivially-weak `inv`) is an
//! [`RefEncodeError::Unsupported`] (R-HONEST-3 — Skipped, never silently
