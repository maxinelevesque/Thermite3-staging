//! The stratified two-phase translation validation + the trust flip — stage-2 REQ-8
//! (`.design/stage2-stratified-cage.md` REQ-8 / AC-8; metatheory sketch §8.2).
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! Stage-2 stratified clauses (admitted `forall`/`exists` array-property formulas) are
//! lowered to a Verus MBQI surface by the production lowerer
//! (`thermite_lower`, `Expr::Quantifier`) and, independently, by the stratified
//! reference encoder ([`crate::strat_ref_encode`]). The two-phase TV certifies the two
//! agree — the stratified analogue of the contract-TV equivalence
//! ([`crate::obligation`]), but over quantified formulas, where a single per-clause Z3
//! `<==>` query is negation-unfriendly (an `assert(P <==> Q)` over `forall`s pushes the
//! solver into the same instantiation search the cage exists to avoid).
//!
//! ## The two phases (metatheory §8.2)
//!
//! - **Phase 1 — syntactic** (the common path): normalize both encodings to the layer-1
//!   canonical form ([`crate::normalize`], carrying `nnf_sound`/`prenex_sound` — the
//!   Lean `Strat/Nnf.lean` lemmas these passes mirror) and compare byte-for-byte. A hit
//!   certifies equivalence without a solver call. SPIKE-2 measured 40/40 = 100 %
//!   syntactic coverage over the corpus, clearing the ≥ 90 % bar (Q-TV2), so this is the
//!   dominant path.
//! - **Phase 2 — semantic** (the thin fallback): on a syntactic miss, emit the
//!   negation-unfriendly quantified-equivalence Z3 query with FINITE-bound assertions
//!   ([`semantic_obligation`]) and run it. The two non-quantifier combinators
//!   (`count_where`, a recursive `nat` fold; `permutation_of`, a multiset equality;
//!   REQ-6) have no raw-quantifier spelling, so they bypass phase 1 entirely
//!   ([`ClauseRoute::DirectSemantic`]) and land here directly.
//! - **Timeout** is HONEST: a solver timeout in phase 2 WITHHOLDS the certificate
//!   ([`TvVerdict::Withheld`]) — it is never reported as a pass. A withheld clause keeps
//!   the conservative trust profile; it does not flip (see [`strat_trust_profile`]).
//!
//! ## The trust flip (the G2 gate)
//!
//! During the rollout window a stratified clause carries `trust: solver(z3) +
//! ref_encode(strat, UNPROVEN — stage 2 in progress)`, recording that the reference
//! encoder's soundness (T1-S/T2-S) is proven but the END-TO-END flip is gated on G2
//! (`make audit` [1′][4′][8][9] green, REQ-9). The flip to the proven form
//! `ref_encode(strat)` is the one-LINE change of the [`G2_FLIPPED`] gate, and is itself
//! a tested code path ([`strat_trust_profile`] + the toggle test). The gate constraint
//! (REQ-5 option B / REQ-9): the flip must not trigger on REQ-5's structural soundness
//! alone — it attests "proven over source meaning", which is REQ-8's atom-grounding
//! (`lean/Thermite/Strat/Faithfulness.lean` T2-S), gated on the audit.
//!
//! ## Independence
//!
//! Like the contract-TV, this module depends on `thermite-syntax` + `thermite-spec`
//! only — never `thermite-lower`. The production encoding is passed IN (the caller —
//! `forge` — supplies the lowerer's output); the reference is computed here. Sharing the
//! lowerer would make the check vacuous.
