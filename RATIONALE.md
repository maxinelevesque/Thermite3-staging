# RATIONALE — the metaphor-to-mechanism resolution layer

The [README](README.md) uses plain terms: "a cage," "the ladder," "promises," "a
certificate," "kill the mutants." This file makes each term precise. For
each, it records the established concept it implements (with lineage), the
mechanism (file and symbol pointers into this repo), the engineering tradeoff
behind it, the limits (where it does not protect), and the planned direction
(with a tracking pointer).

Lineage attributions point to the published literature for context. Three
components are new as far as a [SOTA survey](.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md)
found, and it records the hedge on each:

- the **caged quantifier fragment** — "no direct analogue in the surveyed
  verified-compilation literature; needs a targeted survey to confirm novelty";
- the **anti-Goodhart battery** — "no analogue in the surveyed
  verified-compilation literature";
- the **effect-row→seccomp hybrid** — the surveyed effect literature "does not
  combine static effect typing with runtime syscall confinement," so the hybrid
  is asserted by absence, pending its own survey of the row-effect and
  seccomp/CHERI literature.

These are claims about one survey's coverage. The rest of the document
assembles, in standard vocabulary, what the code and the `.design/` docs
establish.

## The contract (`req` / `ens` / `fx`)

**Definition.** Pre/postconditions plus an effect annotation: **design-by-contract**
(Meyer/Eiffel) realized as machine-checked **Hoare logic** (Hoare 1969;
modern push-button precedent: Dafny, Verus, F*). `req` is the precondition, `ens`
the postcondition (over a distinguished `result` binding and the function's
parameters; Thermite has no `old(_)` pre-state construct, and the spec grammar
exposes `result` plus the in-scope parameters and nothing more), and `fx` is an
**effect row** (its own entry below). Thermite's departure from the lineage is
that all three are **mandatory syntax**: omitting one is a compile error rather
than a lint.

**Mechanism.** The contract is parsed into `Contract { req, ens, fx }` clauses
(`thermite-syntax/src/ast.rs`); `thermite-spec`'s `validate` (`validator.rs`)
enforces that every contract-position expression stays inside the frozen
sublanguage; `thermite-lower` lowers `req`/`ens` to Verus `requires`/`ensures`
and `fx` to a compile-time subsumption check (`effects.rs`) plus a runtime
sandbox (`forge/src/sandbox.rs`). See
[`.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md`](.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md),
[`.design/lower/effect-subsumption.md`](.design/lower/effect-subsumption.md).

**Why this design.** The alternative, contracts as optional annotations, is what
every prior contract system chose, and it is why they did not change behaviour at
scale: the path of least resistance is to write no contract, so most code carries
none, so the guarantee is opt-in and therefore absent where it matters. Thermite's
bet (README "The problem") is that AI agents flip the keystroke economics, so the
tool can afford to make the strict path the *only* path. Mandatory contracts are
the anti-Goodhart precondition: a tool that grades contract strength (the battery,
below) is meaningless if a function can score perfectly by declaring no contract
at all. Making the contract mandatory closes that escape before the battery runs.

**Limits / failure modes.** A *stated* contract does not guarantee *correct
intent*: `ens` can be mechanically satisfiable yet say the wrong thing (`ens true`
is the degenerate case). Mandatoriness buys presence rather than meaning; the
battery (below) attacks the weak-but-present case, and the gap between the formal
spec and the human's actual intent is the irreducible residual (`thermite-design.md`
§1 "spec-intent alignment," never machine-closed).

**Direction.** Strengthening probes (§7 step 5,
[`.design/forge/strengthening-probes.md`](.design/forge/strengthening-probes.md))
*propose* a tighter `ens` that still proves against the unchanged body, moving a
present-but-weak contract toward a stronger one without authoring it for the user.

## The ladder (L4 / L3 / L2 / L1 / L0)

**Definition.** Five assurance tiers ranked by *refutation quality*, each a
distinct established verification technique:

- **L4** = **kernel-grounded** discharge. For nonlinear arithmetic the *relax
  route* proves the goal over the reals (Z3's **nlsat**, a complete decision
  procedure for real-closed fields) and transports it to the integers through a
  **Lean-kernel-checked** soundness lemma (`r_relax_sound`); the trust base is
  `solver(nlsat) + spine-lemma(kernel)`, strictly above an L3 SMT-solver proof.
- **L3** = **SMT-discharged deductive verification**, proven for *all* inputs.
  Via Verus (the Rust verifier) emitting verification conditions to **Z3**
  (the SMT solver). Total correctness over the frozen fragment.
- **L2** = **bounded model checking** (Kani/CBMC lineage; Alive2 for the
  "sound-for-reported-violations, incomplete" framing), proven for all inputs up
  to a stated size bound.
- **L1** = **runtime contract monitoring**, the contract compiled to
  always-active assertions that abort on violation (design-by-contract's runtime
  half).
- **L0** = **a trusted-by-fiat annotation**, CompCert's "reduced trusted base"
  concept made per-function; the `#[slag]` escape hatch (own entry below).

**Mechanism.** `enum Level { L0, L1, L2, L3, L4 }` (`forge/src/manifest.rs`,
derived `Ord` so `L0 < L1 < L2 < L3 < L4`). The default `forge check` path
attempts L3 and auto-degrades on a *timeout*: `forge::degrade::run_ladder` (`forge/src/degrade.rs`)
drives `L3Verdict::Proved → certify L3`; `Timeout → attempt L2 (lower_l2 →
run_kani) → … → L1 (lower_l1)`. The three-way verdict that drives it is
`classify_verus_outcome → VerusOutcome { Proved, Timeout, Counterexample }`
(`forge/src/check.rs`). See
[`.design/forge/degrade-ladder.md`](.design/forge/degrade-ladder.md).

**Why this design (the degrade-never-on-counterexample policy).** A solver gives
three answers rather than two: *proved*, *disproved* (with a counterexample), and
*could not decide in budget* (timeout / `unknown`). The ladder degrades **only the
third**. A `Counterexample` (the solver found an input where the contract is
false) is a hard failure that never degrades to a lower rung (`ladder_action_l3`
maps it to `LadderAction::HardFail`, `forge/src/degrade.rs`). The alternative,
softening a disproof into "it passes at L1," would hide a *known* bug behind a
lowered-assurance stamp, the worst outcome and the failure §12 ("bounded checks
oversold as proofs") exists to prevent. Degrading inconclusiveness keeps the gate
from *blocking* an agent on a hard SMT goal (§5.2 "the gate degrades, it never
blocks"); refusing to degrade falsity keeps it from reporting a known bug as
passing. The two rules pull in opposite directions, and the policy resolves every
ambiguity toward "never hide a bug" (R-DEFER-9; the L2 counterexample-vs-under-bound
split, the riskiest case, defaults to treating an ambiguous failure as a
counterexample, `.design/forge/degrade-ladder.md` OQ-2).

**Limits / failure modes.** L3 is total correctness *relative to Z3's soundness*
(see the Lean proof spine entry). L2 is bounded and can miss a bug above its size
bound (this is by design, the BMC tradeoff). L1 catches violations only at
runtime, on the inputs actually executed. L0 is trusted, with no further check. A
`fx diverge` function is *capped* at L1 (partial correctness) because it may not
terminate, so it cannot claim L3-total: a structural cap decided before the prover
runs, distinct from a timeout degrade (`.design/forge/degrade-ladder.md` REQ-9).

**Direction.** A standing background proof-repair loop (§5.2, #18) drives
degraded L1/L2 items back up toward L3; the proof-backend interface
([`.design/verified/proof-backends.md`](.design/verified/proof-backends.md))
generalizes the ladder so an L3 can be discharged by Lean as well as Verus, with
a smaller trusted base. The downward degrade above applies to an *inconclusive
in-cage* goal (a solver timeout); an obligation the decidable cage cannot hold at
all now escalates **up** to the **forge** — an agent-authored proof term checked
by the Lean 4 kernel, falsified first by a mandatory covenant — instead of the
whole function sliding down. This forge tier and the L4 relax route were the
Stage-1 deliverable of the Thermite 2 program
([RFC-1, GH #2](https://github.com/dollspace-gay/Thermite/issues/2)). The
shipped ladder now also places reconstructed fixed-width BV clauses and
admitted finite relation/array clauses at L4. Plain `forge check` selects those
routes automatically when a clause qualifies.

## The "cage" / seccomp sandbox

**Definition.** A **seccomp-BPF syscall filter**, the same in-kernel
system-call filtering mechanism Docker and Chrome use to confine processes. The
`fx` row is compiled to a syscall **allowlist**; a syscall outside it makes the
Linux kernel kill the process with `SIGSYS`. This is the README's "cage."

**Mechanism.** `forge/src/sandbox.rs`: `emit_sandbox_prelude` hand-builds a
classic `sock_filter[]` BPF program (arch-guard on `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64`, a
`BPF_JEQ` per allowlisted syscall number → `SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW`, default
`SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`) and installs it via raw `extern "C"`
`prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)` + `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER)`,
injected as the first statements of the generated `main` (`synthesize_entry_main`
in `build.rs`), *before* the entry function runs. The allowlist is derived by
`transitive_fx`: the union of `manifest::effects_of` over the entry plus its
transitive intra-file call closure (`closure::reachable_in_file_fns`), mapped
token→syscalls by `syscall_allowlist` (`pure` → a minimal run/print/exit
baseline that pointedly *excludes* `openat`/`socket`/`getrandom`/`clock_gettime`;
`read(_)` adds `openat`; `term` adds `ioctl`; etc.). See
[`.design/forge/runtime-sandbox.md`](.design/forge/runtime-sandbox.md).

**Why seccomp (and not ptrace / LSM / AppArmor / containers).** The requirement
is to enforce a *per-function, statically-derived* effect set at the syscall
boundary, with no trusted supervisor process and minimal runtime cost.

- **ptrace** needs a separate tracer process intercepting every syscall, which
  adds a supervisor to the trusted base and a context-switch per call.
- **LSM / AppArmor** are system-administrator policy, configured out-of-band and
  not derived from or pinned to the program's own declared effects; they would
  decouple the runtime grant from the compile-time `fx` row.
- **containers** confine at the wrong granularity (a whole filesystem/network
  namespace) rather than the per-function effect set.
- **seccomp-BPF** runs *in-kernel* with no supervisor, and the filter is a pure
  function of the verified `fx` row: the same `transitive_fx` walk the
  compile-time subsumption check uses, read forward. The grant *is* the
  verified effects. That direct derivation is why seccomp was chosen here.

**Limits / failure modes (the README's "tripwire").**

- **Linux-only, x86_64-only** in v0.1: the filter pins `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64`;
  other platforms get the `--no-sandbox` no-op fallback
  (`.design/forge/runtime-sandbox.md` OQ-3).
- **Syscall-number granularity only *in v0.1*, a filter choice rather than a
  mechanism limit.** Classic seccomp-BPF exposes the syscall's scalar argument
  *values* in `seccomp_data.args[0..5]`, and a BPF program can `BPF_JEQ` on them
  (Chrome's sandbox filters `ioctl` by its `cmd` exactly this way). What classic
  seccomp-BPF *cannot* do is **dereference a pointer argument**: the kernel forbids
  reading pointed-to memory from a filter precisely to avoid TOCTOU (the argument
  could be rewritten between the filter check and the syscall). A `cmd` (a scalar)
  is therefore filterable, but a *path* or any other string behind a pointer is
  not inspectable at this layer. v0.1's filter matches on `nr` only, an
  implementation choice rather than a mechanism ceiling, so the `term`→`ioctl`
  grant is currently `ioctl`-*broad* (any cmd), documented as the v1 scope
  (`.design/forge/runtime-sandbox.md` OQ-5). **Path-scoping is enforced at the
  language level** (the `fx read(path)` row, compile-time) because seccomp
  *structurally cannot* read the path string; with seccomp as the coarse syscall
  backstop, the two layers are complementary rather than redundant.
- **Memory safety is not this layer's job**; that is Rust's borrow checker /
  LLVM (the target's responsibility, the RustBelt/Stacked Borrows boundary,
  SOTA finding #7).
- **Pure Thermite never *triggers* it.** A pure program issues no disallowed
  syscall, so the filter never fires; the cage's value is confining
  `#[boundary]`/`#[slag]` foreign bodies to their declared `fx`, plus a
  defense-in-depth backstop against a miscompilation. Demonstrated by an explicit
  `--sandbox-self-test` probe (a denied `openat` → exit 159 = 128+SIGSYS, versus a
  clean pure run).

**This is a genuine extension (asserted by absence, survey pending).** The
*hybrid* (a static effect row (`fx`) that is *both* the compile-time subsumption
lattice *and* the source of the runtime syscall allowlist) has no analogue in the
surveyed effect literature (Koka/Eff/Frank do row effects; seccomp/CHERI do
confinement; no surveyed system derives the second from the first). The survey is
explicit that this is **asserted by absence and still needs its own targeted
survey** of the row-effect + seccomp/CHERI literature to confirm (survey gap #3),
[`.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md`](.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md)
terminology-map row "static effect-rows (`fx`) + seccomp confinement."

**Direction.** A scalar-argument-filtering build (a `BPF_JEQ` on the `ioctl` cmd
register, a scalar, so this is within classic seccomp-BPF's ability, narrowing
`term` to `TCGETS`/`TCSETS`) and non-Linux backends are future refinements
(`.design/forge/runtime-sandbox.md` OQ-5/OQ-3). Pointer-behind arguments (paths)
stay at the language layer by mechanism, not by schedule.

## The certificate

**Definition.** A **JSON manifest**, the stable, versioned data contract
`forge check` emits per item; the deliverable's machine-readable trust statement
(§5.1, §6, Appendix A). It attests *what was proved and how*; it does **not**
attest *intent*.

**Mechanism.** `struct Certificate { item, level, solver_time_ms,
contract_quality, effects, slag, obligations, suggested_move, … }`
(`forge/src/manifest.rs`), serialized with `serde_json`. Key fields: `level`
(`L0..L4`, the ladder rung); `effects` (the `fx` row); `contract_quality`
(`tautology`, `vacuous_precondition`, `mutants_killed: String` e.g. `"17/18"`,
`survivor`), the battery scores; `obligations: Vec<ObligationResult>`, per
proof obligation, `Discharged` or `Failed` with a `location` + a concrete
`diagnostic` ("counterexamples, not adjectives," §5.1); `slag`/`slag_meta`
(fiat-trust flag + justification). See
[`.design/forge/certificate-manifest.md`](.design/forge/certificate-manifest.md).
The project-level aggregate (`AssuranceManifest`, min-over-functions) and the
full audit deliverable (`AuditManifest`, `forge/src/audit.rs`) build on it.

**Why this design.** The schema is *fixed at its full Appendix A shape now* even
though several producers (the battery, mutation) arrive over later issues:
forward-declared fields are present with non-asserted values rather than absent,
so a later component *fills* a field instead of *reshaping* the schema
(`certificate-manifest.md` "the two-speed schema"). A field add/rename is a design
amendment (R-SPEC-2) rather than a code-local choice, because the certificate *is*
the contract a downstream auditor pins. The non-deterministic `solver_time_ms` is
structurally excluded from the oracle comparison so the cert stays reproducible
(R-CODE-5).

**Limits / failure modes.** The certificate attests the *formal* result rather
than the *intended* one: a `level: L3` cert with `mutants_killed: "18/18"` says
"this body provably satisfies this contract for all inputs, and the contract is
strong enough to catch every mutant," and it says **nothing** about whether the
contract is the one the human wanted (the §1 intent gap, surfaced for human review,
never machine-closed). The version-sensitive battery ratio (`mutants_killed`) is
oracle-*excluded* because a stronger prover may shift it
(`mutation-scoring.md` REQ-8).

**Direction.** Per-obligation engine attribution
([`.design/verified/proof-backends.md`](.design/verified/proof-backends.md)
REQ-4): the cert gains, per discharged obligation, the engine that proved it and
that engine's trust profile, so an auditor sees that an L3-via-Lean enumerates a
smaller trusted base than an L3-via-Verus.

---

## The vacuity battery (the anti-Goodhart layer)

**Definition.** A mandatory anti-gaming layer combining **vacuity detection**
(model-checking lineage; a property that holds trivially is flagged) with
**mutation testing** (DeMillo/Lipton/Sayward 1978; Hamlet), which generates
deliberately-broken copies of a body and requires the contract to *catch* them,
plus a **kill-ratio floor** and a **prover-proved-equivalent-mutant exclusion**.
This is the README's "you can't cheat the grade."

**Mechanism.** Run as §7 steps 1–4 inside the `forge check` gate, after a
successful L3 proof:

- **structural triage** (`vacuity::triage`, `forge/src/vacuity.rs`): rejects
  `ens true`, result-omitting, req-implied, and unjustified-maximal-`fx`
  contracts;
- **solver vacuity** (`vacuity_solver::solver_vacuity_check`): two
  inverted-polarity Verus harnesses detect semantic tautology / unsatisfiable
  precondition (a *proved* degenerate-property harness is the failing case);
- **mutation scoring** (`forge/src/mutation.rs`): `generate` produces a frozen,
  deterministic mutant set (operator flips, off-by-ones, early returns, branch
  swaps; `MUTANT_CAP = 64`), each re-lowered and re-verified against the
  *unchanged* contract; a mutant Verus **rejects** is *killed* (the contract
  caught it), and a mutant Verus **proves** is a *survivor* (the contract is too
  weak to tell it from the real body). `MUTATION_FLOOR = 0.60` gates
  certification: `kill_ratio < floor` → does not certify,
  `RejectReason { cause: "WeakContract" }` + the surviving mutant as a precise
  strengthening prompt;
- **equivalent-mutant exclusion** (`equivalent-mutants.md`, `#101`): a survivor
  Verus proves *observably equivalent to the real body under `req`* is dropped
  from the denominator (it was never evidence of weakness). This is
  sound-but-incomplete: a survivor is excluded **only** on a Verus *proof* of
  equivalence, so a genuinely distinguishing survivor is never excluded.

See [`.design/forge/mutation-scoring.md`](.design/forge/mutation-scoring.md),
[`.design/forge/equivalent-mutants.md`](.design/forge/equivalent-mutants.md),
[`.design/forge/vacuity-triage.md`](.design/forge/vacuity-triage.md),
[`.design/forge/solver-vacuity.md`](.design/forge/solver-vacuity.md).

**Why this design.** A *mandatory* contract creates a Goodhart pressure: when the
metric is "has a proven contract," the cheapest way to score is a contract so
weak it proves trivially (`ens true`, or `ens result <= huge_bound`). Vacuity
detection catches the *syntactically/semantically* trivial cases; mutation
scoring catches the harder case, a contract that is non-vacuous yet still fails to
constrain the body, by checking whether it can distinguish the real body from a
sabotaged one. The kill-ratio *floor* (rather than 100%) is the concession that
some mutants are equivalent or unreachable; the *equivalent-mutant exclusion*
makes the floor fair (otherwise an honest forced-output function, `req x == 0,
ens result == 0`, is falsely flagged `WeakContract` because its `return 0` mutant
is *genuinely* indistinguishable). The polarity is inverted by design: a prover
*success* on a mutant is the failing case, which is why the battery is a real
adversary rather than a rubber stamp.

**Limits / failure modes.** Mutation testing is incomplete: the mutant set is
finite and frozen, so a weakness no mutant exercises is not caught (the floor is
a *floor* rather than a proof of contract completeness). The kill ratio is
verus-version-sensitive (a stronger prover proves one more mutant), so it is
asserted as a threshold + a run-equals-run determinism property rather than a
frozen golden string (`mutation-scoring.md` OQ-1). A timeout-on-a-mutant is
conservatively counted *killed* (an unproved mutant is not a survivor;
`mutation-scoring.md` OQ-4).

**This is a genuine extension (bounded to the survey).** The anti-Goodhart battery
(mutation-kill-ratio + vacuity/tautology detection applied to *contract quality*)
has "no analogue in the surveyed verified-compilation lit"
([`.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md`](.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md)
terminology-map row "anti-Goodhart battery" → GENUINE EXTENSION), a claim about
*that* survey rather than an absolute first.

**Direction.** The battery becomes engine-generic
([`.design/verified/proof-backends.md`](.design/verified/proof-backends.md)
REQ-9): a Lean-proven contract still faces mutation, with kill semantics
`Refuted ∪ Unknown-after-attempt` and an honest "untested against engine X" when
no engine's fragment admits a mutant.

---

## `#[slag]`

**Definition.** A **trusted-code annotation**, the explicit and visible escape
hatch for a function whose body is *not* machine-proved. Lineage: Rust's `unsafe`,
Dafny's `assume`, Coq/Lean's `axiom`/`admit`, CompCert's enumerated trusted base
made per-function (SOTA finding #3). It is the README's "L0 — trusted by fiat."

**Mechanism.** `forge/src/slag.rs`: `pub fn validate(&SlagAttr) -> Result<SlagMeta,
SlagError>` requires the three justification fields `reason` / `owner` / `review`
present *and* non-empty (`None` → `MissingField`, empty-after-`trim` →
`EmptyField`). A valid `#[slag]` item is **L3-exempt but L1-enforced**: `forge
check` does not invoke Verus on it; it certifies `Level::L1` with `slag: true`
and the metadata in the certificate, and its contract is still compiled to runtime
checks. It is the only construct that justifies a maximal `fx` row (the §7.1(d)
vacuity interaction), and it remains subject to the vacuity triage rules (a) /
(b) / (c): slag exempts a body from *proving*, never from *stating and checking*.
See [`.design/forge/slag.md`](.design/forge/slag.md).

**Why visible and greppable.** The escape hatch is deliberately less convenient
than the proven path (§8's "polarity inversion"): three mandatory justification
fields and a `grep`-able keyword. The alternative, a quiet pragma or a default-on
"trust me" mode, makes the trusted base invisible and therefore unbounded, and a
reviewer cannot audit what they cannot enumerate. Making non-verification cost
*more* keystrokes and visibility means `grep slag` over a codebase is the
**complete inventory** of fiat-trusted code (§8), and the certificate surfaces
every slag block with its justification.

**Limits / failure modes.** A slag body is genuinely unverified; its correctness
rests entirely on the human reviewer the `review` field names. Slag caps the item
at L1 (runtime contract enforcement), so a slag body's *contract* is still
checked at runtime, but the body's logic below that contract is trusted. A slag
block is a hole in the proof; the hole is *enumerated* rather than absent.

**Direction.** CI policy hooks that cap slag count or require second-party
sign-off (§8) are a later policy layer; the `forge audit` TCB section
([`.design/forge/audit-manifest.md`](.design/forge/audit-manifest.md)) already
enumerates every slag block as part of the trusted computing base.

---

## The combinator cage

**Definition.** A **fixed, closed quantifier fragment with hand-tuned, frozen SMT
triggers**, the deliberately-weak specification sublanguage (SpecTherm). Eight
bounded combinators stand in for raw `forall`/`exists`. Lineage: the broad idea
of restricting to a decidable/automatable fragment is standard (the "cage = a
decidability/automation lever," SOTA finding #4); the *specific* frozen-trigger
combinator set is a project extension (below).

**Mechanism.** `thermite-spec/src/combinators.rs` ships the frozen registry
(`sorted`, `forall_in`, `exists_in`, `count_where`, `permutation_of`, `disjoint`,
`forall_below`, `forall_from`), each with a name, arity, ordered `ArgKind`s
(`Slice`/`Index`/`Pred`/`Value`), result kind, and a frozen `verus_l3` quantifier
body carrying a pinned `#[trigger]` (e.g. `forall_in(s,p) == forall|i| 0 <= i <
s.len() ==> #[trigger] p(s[i])`). `thermite-spec/src/validator.rs` (`validate`)
enforces that contracts use *only* registered combinators (right name/arity/
arg-kinds), declared `spec fn` calls, and grammar built-ins, and that a
combinator's predicate-closure body is a **flat predicate** (no anonymous nested
combinator; named `spec fn` composition only; REQ-6, the `#40` fix). See
[`.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md`](.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md).

**Why no raw `forall`.** Unrestricted quantifiers in an SMT backend are the
primary source of proof *instability*: the solver instantiates quantifiers via
**trigger** (e-matching) heuristics, and small edits to a formula can flip a
proof to a timeout or matching loop as the solver's trigger inference changes
(§13 risk "small edits flip proofs to timeouts"). The alternatives,
(a) letting users write raw `forall` and rely on the solver coping, or (b)
requiring users to hand-author triggers, both expose the agent to that
instability and make proof success non-reproducible. The cage instead offers a
*fixed* library where every quantifier is bounded (eliminating unbounded-quantifier
blowup) and carries a *frozen, hand-tuned* trigger (removing the heuristic
variance). The restriction is what makes proof automation *predictable*, and
predictable automation is what makes the Lean proof spine and the mutation battery
*feasible* (see the frozen-subset entry). What is excluded: anonymous nested
quantification (`forall_in(xs, |x| exists_in(ys, |y| …))`), raw `forall`/`exists`,
and unbounded recursion without a `dec` measure.

**Limits / failure modes.** The fragment is *deliberately* less expressive than
full first-order logic: a property no combination of the eight combinators (plus
named `spec fn`s) can express simply cannot be stated. Adding a combinator is a
slow, budget-gated RFC rather than a user-level abstraction (§11), so
expressiveness grows only by deliberate design amendment. The invariant is "every
quantifier is a bounded combinator with a frozen trigger; composition is named
(`spec fn`, each `dec`-measured) and never anonymous"; depth is named and bounded
rather than zero (`spectherm-combinators.md` "Thesis-clarification note").

**This is a genuine extension (with the survey's hedge).** The caged quantifier
fragment (the specific bounded-combinator set + frozen triggers) is asserted
novel-by-absence: the SOTA survey records "no *direct* analogue in the surveyed
verified-compilation lit" and explicitly adds it "**needs a targeted survey to
confirm novelty**"
([`.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md`](.design/research/formal-methods-sota.md)
terminology-map row "caged quantifier fragment"). The claim is bounded to that
survey, not absolute.

**Direction.** New combinators arrive only through the RFC process (§11); the
flat-closure rule (REQ-6, `#40`) tightens the cage where the early
implementation over-permitted nested quantification.

---

## The effect row (`fx`)

**Definition.** An **effect system** (algebraic/row effects: Koka, Eff, Frank,
F* effects) realized as a static lattice over a fixed atom set, with both a
**compile-time subsumption** check and a **runtime derivation** (the seccomp
sandbox). The README's "what I'm allowed to touch."

**Mechanism.** `enum Effect { Read(p), Write(p), Net(d), Alloc, Time, Rand,
Panic, Diverge, Term }` and `enum EffectRow { Pure, Set(...) }`
(`thermite-syntax/src/ast.rs`). `thermite-lower/src/effects.rs` projects a row to
`EffectKind` atoms (`effects`), and `pub fn subsumes` enforces the rule *a
caller's row must subsume every callee's row* (`effects(callee) ⊆
effects(caller)`; `Pure` subsumes only `Pure`); `check_effects` walks every call
site, emitting `LowerError::EffectNotSubsumed { caller, callee, missing, span }`
on a violation. The subset test is delegated to the Verus-verified
`thermite_verified::subsumes_masks` (a 9-atom `u16` bitset, proved, then
cross-checked over all 512×512 mask pairs). At runtime the *same* row drives the
seccomp allowlist (`transitive_fx` → `syscall_allowlist`, the cage entry above).
See [`.design/lower/effect-subsumption.md`](.design/lower/effect-subsumption.md).

**Why this design.** Subsumption is checked *directly* (each call site against the
immediate callee's declared row) rather than via a transitive closure walk,
because every callee's declared row must *already* subsume its own callees
(checked when that callee is analyzed), so direct checking composes to transitive
correctness (`effect-subsumption.md` OQ-2). This is the §9 "trust is invariant
under composition" property: a caller reasons through a callee's *contract* (here
its `fx` row) rather than its body. Path granularity (`write("/tmp")` ⊄
`write("/etc")`) is deferred to a future path lattice; v0.1 is atom-kind level and
explicit about what it enforces (`effect-subsumption.md` OQ-1).

**Limits / failure modes.** v0.1 subsumption is path-*insensitive* (a `Write(_)`
caller subsumes any `Write(_)` callee); path-scoping is stated at the row level
but not yet ordered by path. Compile-time subsumption alone does not *enforce* at
runtime; the runtime half is the seccomp cage (a separate, Linux-only,
coarse-grained layer with its own limits).

**This is part of the genuine extension**: the *hybrid* of static effect typing
*and* runtime syscall confinement derived from the same row (see the cage entry).

**Direction.** A path lattice for path-granular subsumption matching the runtime
sandbox granularity (`effect-subsumption.md` OQ-1).

## Translation validation + the Lean proof spine

**Definition.** Two composed techniques answering whether the *translation* is
faithful:

- **Translation validation** (Pnueli/Siegel/Singerman 1998; Necula's GCC
  validator PLDI'00; Alive2 PLDI'21): a *per-run* check that an unverified
  translator produced an equivalent output, via an **independent reference
  encoder** and an SMT equivalence query. It gives *existential* evidence (for the
  programs that were run).
- **A verified validator** (Leroy/CompCert; the CACM "verified validator composed
  with an unverified compiler is as strong as a verified compiler, provided the
  validator is smaller and simpler"): the reference encoder is itself *proven
  sound* in **Lean 4**, lifting the per-run check to a *universal* **semantic
  preservation** guarantee (`S ≈ C`, stated as a forward simulation).

**Mechanism.** Per run: `thermite-tv`'s `equivalence_obligation` family
(`thermite-tv/src/obligation.rs`) emits a self-contained Verus program asserting
`(P_production) <==> (P_reference)`, where `P_reference` comes from the
independent reference encoders (`ref_encode.rs` / `exec_encode.rs` /
`exec_stmt_encode.rs`), forbidden by the build from sharing code with the
production lowerer; Z3 must prove both translations equivalent on every check.
Once and for all: the `lean/Thermite/` spine proves those reference encoders
denotation-faithful against a mechanized semantics `S` (`theorem ref_sound` /
`ref_sound_eq` (`Soundness.lean`), `exec_ref_sound` (`Exec.lean`),
`body_ref_sound` (`Exec/Stmt.lean`), the partial-correctness `while_rule`
(`Exec/Loop.lean`)), composed into `theorem lowering_faithful`
(`Faithfulness.lean`). The Rust encoders are tied to their Lean models by an
arm-by-arm inspection audit with pinned commits
([`.design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md`](.design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md)).
See [`.design/verified/thermite-semantics.md`](.design/verified/thermite-semantics.md).

**What is proven, precisely (and what is not).** The Lean spine proves (T1) the
reference encoder is sound against `S` (`∀ P, ⟦R(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S`) and composes it
with the per-run Z3 check to get (T2) `⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S` for every `P` passing
TV: the lowering *preserves meaning*. This is the **verified-validator
architecture** (Leroy/CompCert lineage): the *small* reference encoder (≈ one
compiler-pass of effort) is verified rather than the thousands-of-lines production
lowerer. The five load-bearing theorems are kernel-checked depending on **only**
the standard Lean axiom set `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`, with no
`sorry` and no custom axioms (`make audit` check [1] re-verifies this on the
skeptic's machine).

**The enumerated trust base (the residuals, stated rather than hidden).** Following
CompCert's reduced-trusted-base framing (SOTA finding #3, Leroy's "verification
never eliminates the trusted base, it reduces it to an enumerable set"), an L3
certificate currently trusts the following (this is `scripts/audit.sh` check [6]'s
five-item residual-trust block; the checker the spine itself leans on is item 1):

1. **The Lean kernel + its three standard axioms**, `{propext,
   Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. The five load-bearing theorems are checked by
   the Lean kernel, so the kernel's soundness and that small, standard axiom set
   are themselves trusted; `make audit` check [1] re-runs the kernel on the
   skeptic's machine and parses exactly this axiom footprint (no `sorry`, no custom
   axiom).
2. **Z3 / Verus soundness**: the per-run TV equivalence is `Z3 ⊢ lower(P) ⟺
   R(P)`; if Z3 is unsound on a query, (T2) inherits it. This is the floor of any
   SMT-discharged result rather than a Thermite-specific gap.
3. **`S` agrees with the *intended* meaning of Thermite**: the most delicate
   item, an unprovable-from-within assumption (Gödel; the §1 spec-intent slot).
   `S` is human-audited; its auditability is the design goal.
4. **The Rust↔Lean encoder correspondence**: that the *Rust* encoders match the
   *Lean*-proved algorithm, discharged at the **inspection tier** (arm-by-arm
   audit + a SHA-pinned drift tripwire) rather than a mechanized extraction bridge.
5. **rustc / LLVM / the build chain**: the `Rust → machine code` link, inherited
   from the Rust toolchain (the RustBelt/Stacked Borrows boundary).

**Checked clause replay.** Stage 3 replays supported solver verdicts as the
Lean theorem for the route's `req → clause` validity query. QF_LIA uses
`omega`; QF_BV uses literal `BitVec N` terms and an axiom-clean proof
portfolio. A trust migration requires
Lean to accept the theorem and report only `{propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}`. The certificate stores the theorem, checker, generated-source
hash, and axiom list. It also stores the exact solver-input hash when the route
exposes that input.

This removes Z3 from the trust base for each successfully replayed clause,
subject to the inspection-tier correspondence between the SMT and Lean
renderers. Quantified, recursive, relation, and array fragments outside
QF_LIA/QF_BV remain solver-trusted and are named by the audit. See
[`.design/verified/z3-demotion.md`](.design/verified/z3-demotion.md).

**Why Lean 4.** Lean provides both the semantic spine and the kernel target for
proof reconstruction. That lets Thermite check solver-facing theorems without
making Verus/Z3 the definition of the language. The choice and alternatives
are recorded in `thermite-semantics.md` REQ-5.

**Limits / failure modes.** The theorem upgrades exactly *one* link (lowering)
from existential to universal; the Verus VC-generator + Z3, the borrow
checker/LLVM, and the source-semantics-agreement assumption stay inherited
(stated above). It is **not** a whole-toolchain or unconditional preservation
proof; the v1 `while` rule is *partial* correctness (termination is the per-run
Verus `decreases` residual). Loops beyond v1 `while`, `break`/`continue`,
multi-exit early `return`, nested loops, and non-scalar mutation `xs[i]=e` are
out of the proven fragment (`thermite-semantics.md` coverage section).

**Direction.** Full Z3 demotion (upstream-gated) and the Lean→Rust extraction
bridge (to upgrade residual 4, the Rust↔Lean correspondence, from inspection to
mechanization). Lean as proof engine #2 has shipped — the next section.

---

## Proof backends (the second engine)

**Definition.** The L3 discharge is routed through a backend-neutral **engine
interface** (`forge/src/engine.rs`,
[`.design/verified/proof-backends.md`](.design/verified/proof-backends.md)): an
engine declares its FRAGMENT (which obligations it can attempt), a DISCHARGE map
onto the three-verdict lattice `Proven / Unknown / Refuted`, a TRUST PROFILE
(the tools a `Proven` obliges you to trust), and a content-addressed EVIDENCE
key. Verus/Z3 is engine #1 (the default); **Lean is engine #2**
(`forge check --engine lean|auto`): obligations are serialized by the
Thermite→Lean exporter (`forge/src/lean_export.rs`) and discharged either by a
tactic battery (the auto tier) or by a replayed interactive proof.

**The discipline is engine-generic.** `Unknown` degrades down the ladder
in-cage, or escalates up to the forge when the cage cannot hold the obligation; a
witnessed `Refuted` hard-fails and never degrades — the anti-cheat is stated
once, independent of Verus. A certificate carries per-obligation attribution
`{engine, trust_profile}`, so "L3" names *which* engine proved the item under
*which* assumptions; project aggregation stays the honest min.

**Disagreement is an alarm, not a tiebreak.** Under `--engine auto` both
engines may attempt the same obligation. `Proven ⊕ Refuted` halts the run as a
structured soundness alarm naming both engines and the obligation; it is never
resolved by preference — one of the two provers (or the exporter between them)
is wrong, and surfacing exactly that event is the architecture's purpose.
`Proven ⊕ Unknown` is benign (one engine simply could not decide).

**Interactive proofs without an injection surface.** A hard obligation emits a
Lean skeleton (`<file>.lean-proofs/<item>.lean`) carrying an evidence-key
header; the replay reconstructs the file from the canonical generator, so the
*only* author-controlled text is the proof term after the obligation theorem's
`:=`. `sorry` and non-standard axioms are rejected from the obligation
theorem's own `#print axioms` report; a stale evidence key forces
re-derivation. This canonical-reconstruction design closed a five-generation
adversarial bypass arc (#248–#252) in which `notation`/`macro` poisons
re-elaborated the obligation's conclusion to `True` under a clean axiom report
— the lesson being that a blocklist over a Turing-complete elaborator is
unsoundable, so the author-helper surface was deleted rather than filtered.

**Limits / failure modes.** The Lean engine's exportable fragment today is pure
contracts plus straight-line executable bodies; loops and user-ADT `match` are
the named next increments (the spine's `while_rule` already exists, so the loop
extension is engineering rather than new theory). Non-exportable items are
honest `Unverifiable` skips, never false verdicts. Verus remains the sole
engine for the meta/battery queries (vacuity, mutation, strengthening) in v1;
the Lean-path mutation battery covers only the items Lean discharges, with
untested-against-Lean mutants reported and never counted as killed.

**Direction.** Widen the exporter past straight-line bodies (`while` first);
grow the auto-tier tactic coverage; converge with the Z3-demotion arc above.

---

## Typed holes (`?N`) + the goal REPL

**Definition.** **Typed holes** with an incremental **goal state**, the
Agda/Idris interactive-hole and Lean `sorry`-with-goals lineage. A `?N` marks an
unfinished body position; the REPL shows what is given and what must be achieved.

**Mechanism.** The lexer emits `TokKind::Hole(N)` for `?<digits>`
(`thermite-syntax/src/lexer.rs`); the parser accepts it *only* in fn-body
statement position (a `?N` in a spec clause / expression / `spec fn` is a
structured `SyntaxError`, never a panic), recording `FnItem.holes`. `forge
goal <item>` (`goal_repl::render_goal`) renders the §5.1 four-part view
(given / want / per-obligation status with concrete counterexamples / open
holes); `forge fill <addr> <code>` (`goal_repl::fill_hole`) splices code at the
hole's span, re-parses, re-checks, and prints the new goal state (which may
surface new holes); `forge edit`/`battery` are the sibling verbs. The
**never-certifies gate**: `forge check`'s per-item loop short-circuits any holed
`FnItem` to a non-certifying `Level::L0` cert with an `OpenHole` reject cause
**before** lowering or Verus, so a holed program cannot certify. See
[`.design/forge/goal-repl.md`](.design/forge/goal-repl.md).

**Why this design.** This realizes the README's "like a conversation": declare the
contract, leave the body a hole, let the agent fill it and immediately re-check,
with failures coming back as concrete counterexamples (`lo=3, hi=3, mid=3`) rather
than adjectives. The hole gate is the safety interlock: it makes "incomplete" a
*verdict* (non-certifying), so an unfinished program can never masquerade as a
proved one.

**Limits / failure modes.** v1 holes are fn-body-statement position only (no
holes in expressions, signatures, spec clauses); there is no incremental
hole-id stability across fills (holes re-number on re-parse); `fill`/`edit`
re-run the *whole-item* check (the proof cache makes unaffected items cheap), not
incremental obligation-level re-solving (`goal-repl.md` "v1 scope").

**Direction.** Incremental obligation-level re-checking and richer hole positions
are future work; the goal REPL is the v0.1 surface of the §5.1 dialogue.

---

## The frozen subset (the central design *why*)

**Definition.** Thermite is a deliberately **small, frozen language**: a fixed
sublanguage of constructs (the eight combinators, a bounded exec expression set,
straight-line bodies + v1 `while`, `dec`-measured spec functions, the nine effect
atoms). CakeML's "end-to-end verified compilation of a real language, but only
over a *fixed subset*" (POPL'14, SOTA finding #5) is the existence proof that a
frozen subset can be carried to a universal correctness theorem.

**Mechanism.** The freeze is enforced at every layer: `thermite-spec`'s validator
rejects out-of-cage contracts; the reference encoders return `Err`
(`RefEncodeError::Unsupported`) on any node outside the subset; the Lean `Expr` /
`Block` inductives (`lean/Thermite/Ast.lean`) model *exactly* the frozen subset;
the skill (`THERMITE.skill.md`) is regenerated from the registry and CI-gated so
a new construct without a skill entry is a compile error. The denotation domain
of `S` is precisely the union of the three encoders' admitted-node sets
(`thermite-semantics.md` AC-1).

**Why this is THE central design why.** The strong properties of Thermite are
*purchased* by the weakening. The direct answer to "what does the restriction add"
is that the machine-checked soundness proof was only completable because the
fragment is frozen and finite.

- The Lean proof spine (`lowering_faithful`) proves soundness by *structural
  induction over the AST*; that induction is finite, and the proof *closeable*,
  because the construct set is closed and frozen. An open or unbounded surface
  language would have no finite induction to perform.
- The mutation battery is feasible because the mutator families are a fixed,
  finite set over a fixed construct set (`MUTANT_CAP = 64`).
- The combinator cage is *predictable* (frozen triggers, bounded ranges) only
  because the combinator set is closed.
- Z3's automation is reproducible only over the decidable/automatable fragment
  the freeze defines.

The alternative, a large, evolving, general-purpose surface, is what every
unverified language is, and it is *why* their meta-properties are not
machine-checked: an induction over a moving target cannot be finished. The freeze
is the *lever* that makes the strong properties (the universal preservation
theorem, the feasible battery, the predictable solver) achievable. The restriction
purchases the proof.

**Limits / failure modes.** The frozen subset is genuinely less expressive than a
general language; constructs outside it (user-ADT `match`/`is` in the *proven*
fragment, multi-exit control flow, non-scalar mutation, nested loops) are out
(`thermite-semantics.md` coverage; README "Deferred (tracked)"). Growing the
language is a deliberate, RFC-gated, proof-extending act rather than a free
addition.

**Direction.** The proven fragment grows construct-by-construct, each addition
extending the Lean spine and the battery; the named residuals (user-ADT
`match`/`is` in the proven fragment, the basis v1.1 layer) are tracked in the
README's "Deferred" list and the verified-docs coverage sections.

---

## The kernel target

**Definition.** `forge build --target freestanding`, a freestanding `no_std + alloc`,
OS-less library build profile, the road toward a verified microkernel (§13).

**Mechanism.** A codegen-profile fork of `forge build` (`forge/src/build.rs`,
`enum BuildTarget { Std, Freestanding }`): emits a `#![no_std]` + `extern crate alloc;`
rlib (`--crate-type=rlib -C panic=abort`), reusing `thermite_lower::lower_l1`'s
output verbatim (the L1 checks + `TString`/`TVec`/`TMap` wrappers resolve against
`alloc`), with **no** `main` and **no** seccomp sandbox. It adds one new reject:
`reject_ambient_fx_for_freestanding` scans every function's `transitive_fx` for
`KERNEL_REJECTED_FX = ["read","write","net","term","time","rand"]` and refuses
before codegen, because kernel code has no ambient userspace syscall surface (and
no ambient clock/entropy). The admit set is exactly `pure`/`alloc`/`panic`/`diverge`.
The L3 verification path is *target-independent* (untouched). See
[`.design/build/freestanding-target.md`](.design/build/freestanding-target.md).

**Why this design.** Because rustc is the codegen backend (§3), a "target" is a
rustc-invocation + crate-prelude choice rather than a compiler change, so the same
verified, L1-lowered program links into a kernel as into a userspace binary. The
ambient-`fx` reject is the principled boundary: a syscall mapping is a userspace
seccomp concept with no kernel analogue, and the #198 amendment moved
`time`/`rand` into the reject set after a real `fx time` boundary leaked a
std-bodied `SystemTime::now()` (`E0433`) into the `no_std` crate; the doc adapts
to the code (R-DOC-1), documenting the reject the code now enforces.

**Limits / failure modes.** v1 emits a *library* (no `main`, no panic
handler/global allocator; the kernel host supplies them, `kernel-target.md`
OQ-1), and a final `bin`/`staticlib` link is out of v1. L1 checks fire as `panic!`
→ the host's `#[panic_handler]` under `panic=abort`; whether the abort is
observable is the host's responsibility.

**Direction.** A `--target kernel-bin` profile (default abort handler) and the
verified-microkernel convergence (§13).

---

## `make audit`

**Definition.** A skeptic's one-command re-derivation of the entire trust chain on
their own machine, ending with the honest residual-trust statement. The README's
"don't trust us — audit it."

**Mechanism.** `make audit` runs five primary checks plus the Stage-2 G2 gate:
the Lean spine and axiom allowlist; full-corpus contract/expression/body
translation validation; a multi-class falsification battery; the Rust↔Lean
correspondence drift tripwire; and an independent Verus replay with Forge
excluded. G2 additionally combines the stratified axiom probe, mirrored-code
drift check, Rust↔Lean classifier differential, and two-phase faithfulness
sweep through `forge g2-gate`.

The script then prints the verdict and residual-trust statement. A missing
guarantee-bearing tool is a visible skip that makes the result `INCONCLUSIVE`
and nonzero; it cannot be mistaken for a pass. `make audit-fast` is the
60-second A/B demo. See
[`.design/forge/audit-manifest.md`](.design/forge/audit-manifest.md) for the
`forge audit` manifest format.

**Residual trust.** After a clean run, the script still names the Lean kernel
and its three standard axioms, the remaining solver assumptions, the
specification-to-intent gap, the pinned inspection audit, and rustc/LLVM. It
does not pretend these assumptions disappeared.

**Why this design.** A trust statement is only useful if it enumerates its
assumptions, so the audit lists the residual trust items rather than claiming
zero trust, and refuses to claim success when a tool is missing.

**Limits / failure modes.** The audit re-checks the *committed* proof and corpus;
it cannot re-derive the residual trust items (that is what makes them residual).
A missing prover/kernel degrades to `INCONCLUSIVE` rather than a false pass.

**Direction.** As Z3 demotion lands, residual item 2 (Z3/Verus soundness) shrinks
and check [1]'s coverage grows.

---

## Directions (the active roadmap)

- **Lean as proof engine #2 — shipped, now widening**: the backend-neutral
  `Obligation` + `Engine` interface, the Lean exporter, `--engine verus|lean|auto`,
  per-obligation engine attribution, and the disagreement alarm are live
  (#204/#240/#247–#253; the section above). The open work is fragment width:
  the exporter stops at straight-line bodies today (`while` is next — the spine's
  rule is already proven).
  [`.design/verified/proof-backends.md`](.design/verified/proof-backends.md).
- **Wider checked replay**: QF_LIA and the shipped QF_BV surface are live.
  Quantified, recursive, relation, and array obligations still need a
  kernel-checked encoding before their solver trust can move.
  [`.design/verified/z3-demotion.md`](.design/verified/z3-demotion.md)
  (upstream-gated; the scalar core is already a proven PoC).
- **The extraction bridge**: a mechanized Lean→Rust extraction (or a Rust-side
  proof) that makes the Rust reference encoder equal the Lean model *by
  construction*, upgrading the Rust↔Lean correspondence residual from inspection
  to mechanization.
  [`.design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md`](.design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md)
  REQ-2.
- **The microkernel**: the kernel target's destination, a verified, OS-less
  microkernel linked from proven Thermite rlibs (§13).
  [`.design/build/freestanding-target.md`](.design/build/freestanding-target.md).

## What this document is

This is the **metaphor→mechanism resolution layer**. The README uses plain terms
("a cage," "the ladder," "promises," "kill the mutants") for communication. This
file makes each of those terms *precise*: each resolves to an established concept
with a name and a lineage, a concrete mechanism with file+symbol pointers into
this repo, the engineering tradeoff that chose it over its alternatives, the limit
where it stops protecting, and the tracked direction it is heading. Nothing here
is a new claim; it is the assembly, in standard PL/systems vocabulary, of what the
code and the `.design/` docs already establish, so that a skeptical reader can
confirm that every term the project uses names a real thing.
