"""Verify the hook wiring declared by this repository.

The check reads ``.claude/settings.json`` and confirms that every entry in
``REQUIRED_HOOKS`` has a covering matcher and an existing script. A missing or
malformed setting is a finding because Claude Code cannot run that hook.

Exit codes:

* 0: every required hook is wired and present
* 1: missing wiring, a missing script, or invalid settings
* 3: the repository could not be inspected

Usage: ``python3 gates/control-plane-check.py [--root <repo-toplevel>]``

See ``.design/gates/control-plane.md`` for the requirements. The check runs in
CI and through ``make control-plane``; it is not itself a hook or part of
``make audit``. Customize ``SETTINGS_RELPATH`` and ``REQUIRED_HOOKS`` below.
