Critic divergence tests for gates/doc-drift.py (acto-critic, crosslink #258).

Each test pins a DIVERGENCE between the gate's behavior and its authority,
.design/tooling/doc-drift-tripwire.md (REQ-9) + goal.md R-HONEST-3. Expected
values are taken from the design doc's REQ-9 exit-code contract, never from
the tool's own output (R-CHAR-3). These tests FAIL against the current
implementation by construction; they are the audit artifact for the builder's
commit bde2089f.

Divergence inventory:

  C-1  Empty-but-valid route table -> the gate exits 0 having checked ZERO
       docs. Authority: REQ-9 "0 = every routed doc pinned and current ...
       The tool never exits 0 without having checked all 48 docs" +
       R-HONEST-3 (a gate that fails open is a silent pass). A truncated /
       emptied routes.toml silently turns the gate green. Expected: 3
       (INCONCLUSIVE — the enumeration source yielded nothing to check).
  C-2  routes.toml that PARSES as TOML but has the wrong shape
       (`route = 5`, or `route = ["a"]`) -> unhandled Python traceback with
       exit code 1. Authority: REQ-9 "3 = the gate could not determine the
       answer (... routes.toml unreadable)" and AC-5's never-a-traceback
       discipline. Exit 1 is the DRIFT-FOUND class, so an environment defect
       is misreported as a drift finding; the traceback violates the
       "never a traceback" contract the tool's own docstring restates.
  C-3  A [[route]] entry whose `crate_pattern` key is MISSING (a required
       field per the routes.toml schema header), alongside valid
       routes -> the entry was silently dropped, its `design`-field doc
       leaving the checked set, and the gate exited 0. Authority: REQ-5
       ("every doc referenced by a [[route]].design field") + REQ-1 ("the
       set of checked docs is exactly the deduplicated design fields") +
       REQ-8 (no grandfathering) + REQ-9 ("never exits 0 without having
       checked all 48 docs"). Fixed (crosslink #261): a missing/empty
       required field is wrong-shaped -> exit 3 (INCONCLUSIVE).

Run with:  python3 -m unittest discover -s gates/tests -v
(C-1 (#259), C-2 (#260) and C-3 (#261) are now all FIXED and UNGATED —
 permanent regression coverage, no env gate.)
