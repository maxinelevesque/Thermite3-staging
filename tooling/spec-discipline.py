"""Require the relevant design material to be read before source edits.

The PostToolUse hook records reads in ``.crosslink/.spec-reads.json``. The
PreToolUse hook checks Write and Edit requests against ``spec-routes.toml``.
Each routed edit requires ``goal.md``, its design document, and at least one
declared conformance or golden reference when the route specifies references.

Missing routes or design documents block the edit with a corrective message.
See the R-XLATE and R-INJECT rules in ``goal.md`` for the policy.
