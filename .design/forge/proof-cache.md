## Summary

`forge/src/cache.rs` is the per-item, content-addressed proof cache and the
home of the bit-reproducible-verification contract (`thermite-design.md` §5.3:
"Proof results are content-addressed and cached per item"). For each `.th`
item, `forge check` computes a STABLE cache key from everything that determines
the verdict (the item's lowered Verus source + the pinned solver seed + the
verus version + the thermite toolchain version + the item's declared effect
row + the module-internal check-logic schema version — REQ-1 as amended by #49
and by the effect-row input), consults the cache BEFORE
spawning verus, returns the cached certificate on a HIT (skipping the solver),
and stores the result on a MISS. The cache is a PERFORMANCE optimization that
NEVER changes a verdict: a hit is indistinguishable from a fresh verify.

SHIPPED (#8) — `forge/src/cache.rs` implements the key (`cache_key`), the
store/load pair, and the additive `cached` field, consumed by
`check::check_file`'s per-item L3 path (`item_subprogram`, `run_verus`,
`resolve_seed`/`DEFAULT_SOLVER_SEED` are the seams it composes). The REQ-status
table below is the per-REQ evidence, and the **Post-pin amendments** section
records what the four commits since the bootstrap pin changed (re-audited,
#262).

## Post-pin amendments (re-audited 2026-06-12, #262)

Four commits touched `cache.rs` after the bootstrap pin `1dc7c549`. Verified
against the current tree:

- **#49 (`6d7b3aff`) — the stale-verdict gate bypass is closed: a FIFTH key
  input.** `cache_key` hashes, in addition to its four arguments, the
  module-internal `const CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION: u32` (currently `7` — bumped
  `5 → 6` for the #269 F-IDENT/F-STRUCT-ZERO mutant families and `6 → 7` for the
  #269 call-bearing equivalence-exclusion arm; both verdict-changing) — the
  version of forge's VERDICT-AFFECTING CHECK LOGIC. `thermite_version` does
  not suffice: gates ship without a crate-version bump (#12's mutation floor
  landed at 0.1.0), so a cert cached BEFORE a gate existed would be re-served
  under an identical four-input key and skip the now-required gate. The
  maintenance contract (pinned at the const): bump on ANY gate
  add/remove/semantics change. History: 1 = pre-mutation-gate; 2 = the #12
  floor; 3 = the #74 empty-`Vec` early-return synthesis; 4 = the #80
  empty-`String` synthesis; 5 = the #101 equivalent-mutant denominator
  exclusion; 6 = the #269 F-IDENT/F-STRUCT-ZERO mutant families; 7 = the #269
  call-bearing equivalence-exclusion arm (a §9 caller's identity survivor now
  drops modulo callee contracts). REQ-1's "EXACTLY the four inputs" and REQ-2's four-input
  enumeration argument are amended accordingly: four CALLER-passed inputs +
  the check-logic version.
- **Canonical-config-only caching (the floor/rlimit seam, in `check.rs`).**
  `check_file`'s `use_cache` guard consults AND populates the cache only at
  the canonical budget (`rlimit == DEFAULT_RLIMIT` and `mutation_floor ==
  MUTATION_FLOOR`): both knobs are verdict-changing but NOT key inputs, so a
  non-default run BYPASSES the cache entirely (neither served nor written) —
  soundness preserved without widening the key.
- **#13 rejects are cached (solver-vacuity.md GATE-PLACEMENT).** A
  `Certificate::rejected_vacuity` is a settled deterministic verdict and is
  `cache::store`d like a counterexample cert, so a later HIT is verus-free
  end-to-end. REQ-3's "only the L3 path is cached" reading is amended: #6
  structural-triage rejects and slag/boundary L1 short-circuits are still
  never cached (they short-circuit in `gate_fn`, before the key is computed),
  but the #13 SOLVER-vacuity verdict, computed inside the MISS branch, is.
- **The declared effect row is a SIXTH key input.** `cache_key` takes a fifth
  caller-passed argument, `effect_row: &[String]` — the item's declared row as
  the canonical token vector `check::item_effects` produces, which is the same
  value that lands in `Certificate::effects`. The row determines that field, and
  `effects` is the third element of `Certificate::oracle_subset`, so it is one of
  the deterministic fields a hit must agree with a fresh verify on (REQ-2's own
  carve-out names `cached` as the only non-oracle field). The row does not reach
  the lowered source: the bookkeeping labels (`read`, `write`, `net`, `alloc`,
  `time`, `rand`, `panic`, `term`) change no proof obligation and lowering erases
  them, while `diverge` survives through the termination obligation. Two items
  identical but for their row therefore shared a key, and the second was served
  the first's certificate, reporting a row its source does not declare in either
  direction. Measured at staging `b79b4005` and pinned by
  `forge/tests/divergence_cache_effect_row.rs`. REQ-1's "EXACTLY the four inputs"
  and REQ-2's enumeration argument are amended accordingly: five caller-passed
  inputs + the check-logic version. Keying on the same vector the certificate
  carries makes the two impossible to disagree.
- **Engine-discriminated evidence keys (the proof-backends arc; `cache.rs`
  itself unchanged by it).** `engine::engine_cache_key(EngineName,
  content_address)` wraps this module's key into the
  `CacheKey { engine, content_address }` evidence address (`check_file`
  builds it with `EngineName::Verus`), and the Lean engine versions its own
  exporter via `engine::LEAN_SCHEMA_VERSION` — the analogue of
  `CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION` for the Lean path. The on-disk
  `target/thermite-proof-cache/` store is untouched by that arc; `cache_key`'s
  signature gained the effect-row argument separately.

## Requirements

- REQ-1 (cache-key composition — the five oracle-field-determining inputs): the
  cache key for one item is a STABLE sha256 hash over EXACTLY the five inputs
  that determine that item's verdict or one of its oracle fields: (a) the
  item's LOWERED Verus source — the byte string `thermite_lower::lower(&sub)`
  produces for that item's isolated sub-program (`check::item_subprogram`),
  which is what verus actually checks;
  (b) the pinned solver seed (`check::resolve_seed` / `DEFAULT_SOLVER_SEED`,
  §5.3); (c) the verus version; (d) the thermite toolchain version; (e) the
  item's declared effect row, as the canonical token vector that lands in
  `Certificate::effects` (`check::item_effects`). The hash is
  domain-separated and length-prefixed per field so no two distinct input tuples
  collide by concatenation ambiguity; the row is fed as its length followed by
  each token as its own length-prefixed field, so a sequence boundary is
  unambiguous and a reordered row is a different key. The key is the cache's
  content address.
  *(Amended #49: the hash carries a module-internal field —
  `CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION`, the verdict-affecting check-logic version; see
  Post-pin amendments. Amended again for input (e), the declared effect row.)*
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3 ("proof results are content-addressed and
  cached per item"); §12 ("certificates are per-item and content-addressed").
- REQ-2 (the soundness-completeness invariant — a hit equals a fresh verify):
  the key MUST capture everything that affects the proof outcome, so that any
  change to a verdict-determining input changes the key → MISS → re-verify. A
  cache HIT therefore returns the SAME verdict a fresh verus run would, by
  construction. A stale-cache false-L3 (returning L3 when a fresh run would not)
  is a SOUNDNESS HOLE; the completeness of the four-input key (REQ-1) is the
  argument that this cannot occur. The invariant ranges over the certificate's
  oracle fields (`Certificate::oracle_subset`), not the solver outcome alone: a
  hit that agrees on `level` while disagreeing on `effects` still breaks it,
  since both are oracle fields and the certificate is the deliverable
  (`goal.md` R-SPEC-2). An input that determines any oracle field is therefore a
  key input. *(Amended #49: the enumeration includes the
  check-logic version — the gate SET is itself a verdict-determining input.
  Amended again for the declared effect row, which determines `effects` without
  reaching the lowered source.)* The cache is never a way to fabricate a
  verdict (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9 — no proof cheats).
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3 ("a proof that passed yesterday passes today
  unless something semantically relevant changed"); §11 ("never by weakening the
  gate"); `goal.md` R-DEFER-9.
- REQ-3 (lookup-then-store flow in `forge check`, per item): for each item,
  `check::check_file` consults the cache BEFORE `run_verus`: on a HIT it returns
  the stored certificate and does NOT spawn verus; on a MISS it runs verus,
  assembles the certificate, and STORES it under the key. The cache is consulted
  only on the L3 (verus) path — the `#[slag]` L1 short-circuit and a triage
  reject never reach verus (`check::gate_fn`), so they are not cached (no solver
  work to skip). A `spec fn` item, which has no contract obligation, is cached on
  the same lowered-source key as any other item.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3; the existing `check::check_file` per-item
  loop (`run_verus` is the cacheable seam).
- REQ-4 (locality — per-item, not per-crate): the key is computed from the
  item's OWN isolated lowered sub-program (`check::item_subprogram`: the item
  plus the file's `spec fn` dependencies), NOT the whole crate. So an edit to
  item `f` does not change item `g`'s lowered source → `g`'s key is unchanged →
  `g`'s cache entry stays valid (`thermite-design.md` §5.3: "an edit to `f`
  cannot invalidate `g`'s certificate unless `g`'s contract references `f`'s
  contract"). Because a contract reference to a `spec fn` IS part of `g`'s
  sub-program, editing a `spec fn` that `g` references DOES change `g`'s lowered
  source and correctly invalidates `g` — locality and soundness agree.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3 (locality / the per-item invalidation rule);
  §12 ("cross-item invalidation only through contract references").
- REQ-5 (version-keyed invalidation): the verus version and the thermite
  toolchain version are key inputs (REQ-1). A toolchain or verus upgrade changes
  the key for EVERY item → universal MISS → everything re-verifies under the new
  versions. The thermite version is sourced deterministically (the `forge` crate
  `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`); the verus version is sourced from the verus binary
  (`verus --version`) — captured once per run, never wall-clock-derived
  (R-CODE-5). A missing/unreadable verus version is an environment error, not a
  silent empty-string key.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3 ("given the same toolchain version and solver
  seeds"); `goal.md` R-CODE-5.
- REQ-6 (cache location + format — gitignore-able, never committed): cache
  entries live under a project-local cache DIRECTORY,
  `target/thermite-proof-cache/`, one JSON file per key (`<hex-key>.json`)
  holding the stored `Certificate`. The directory MUST be git-ignorable and is
  NOT committed (it is build output, like `target/`). A corrupt/unparseable entry
  is treated as a MISS (re-verify + overwrite), never an error and never a stale
  read. The cache add does NOT alter the golden cert or the conformance corpus.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §11 ("mitigated by per-item caching"); §5.3;
  `goal.md` R-CODE-2 (no panics — IO failures degrade to a MISS, surfaced).
- REQ-7 (the additive `cached: bool` certificate field — observability): the
  `Certificate` schema (`manifest.rs`,
  `.design/forge/certificate-manifest.md`) gains an ADDITIVE `cached: bool`
  field (`#[serde(default)]`, defaulting `false`) recording whether THIS
  certificate came from a cache hit. It follows the #6 `slag_meta`/`reject`
  additive-field pattern: the frozen golden `conformance/sum.cert.json` (which
  omits it) still deserializes, and `cached` is EXCLUDED from the deterministic
  cert-oracle subset (`Certificate::oracle_subset`) — a hit and a fresh verify
  must be oracle-equal, so `cached` cannot be an oracle field (REQ-2). It exists
  so a hit is observable and the soundness test (AC-1) can assert it.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3; `goal.md` R-SPEC-2 (the cert schema is a
  contract; a field add is additive, not a rename); the #6 `slag_meta` precedent
  in `manifest.rs`.
- REQ-8 (bit-reproducible deterministic certificate): given the same lowered
  source + same toolchain + same seed, the certificate's DETERMINISTIC fields
  (`oracle_subset`: `item`, `level`, `effects`, `slag`, plus the per-obligation
  `status`/`name`/`location`) are byte-identical across runs, whether produced
  fresh or from the cache. The only non-deterministic field, `solver_time_ms`,
  is oracle-excluded already (`manifest::Certificate::oracle_subset`). On a HIT,
  `solver_time_ms` reports the STORED value (the cache does not re-measure
  wall-clock; reporting `0` is the alternative — see OQ-2) and `cached` is
  `true`; the deterministic fields match the stored cert exactly.
  Source: `thermite-design.md` §5.3 (bit-reproducible); `goal.md` R-CODE-5;
  `.design/forge/check.md` REQ-7 / `certificate-manifest.md` REQ-6
  (`solver_time_ms` excluded).

## Acceptance criteria

- AC-1 (cache HIT — same verdict, observable, solver skipped): running
  `forge check conformance/sum.th` twice — the first run populates the cache
  (`cached: false`), the second run is a HIT (`cached: true`) with a
  DETERMINISTICALLY EQUAL certificate (`oracle_subset` identical). The strongest
  form: after the first run populates the cache, a second run with the `verus`
  binary UNAVAILABLE (off `PATH`) STILL returns the cached L3 certificate — proof
  that the solver was skipped on the hit (if it were not, REQ-6 of
  `.design/forge/check.md` would make it `ForgeError::VerusAbsent`). This is the
  decisive solver-skip evidence.
- AC-2 (INVALIDATION — any key input change → MISS → re-verify): changing any of
  the four key inputs produces `cached: false` and a fresh verus run. Mechanically
  checkable per input: (a) edit the item's body/contract → different lowered
  source → MISS; (b) change the seed (`resolve_seed`) → MISS; (c) change the
  thermite version component → MISS; (d) change the verus version component →
  MISS. A unit test on the key function asserts each single-input perturbation
  changes the key.
- AC-3 (LOCALITY — editing `f` does not invalidate `g`): in a two-item file
  `f`,`g` (where `g`'s contract does not reference `f`), editing `f`'s body leaves
  `g`'s cache key byte-identical (because `g`'s `item_subprogram` lowered source
  is unchanged) — `g` stays a HIT while `f` becomes a MISS. A unit test computes
  `g`'s key before and after an `f`-only edit and asserts equality, and computes
  `f`'s key and asserts inequality.
- AC-4 (DETERMINISM — identical cert bytes): two fresh `forge check` runs over
  the same `.th` with the same toolchain + seed produce byte-identical
  certificates on the deterministic subset (excluding `solver_time_ms`); and a
  HIT's deterministic subset equals the stored MISS's. A unit test asserts the
  key function is a pure function of its four inputs (same inputs → same hex
  key).
- AC-5 (corpus still certifies; golden still deserializes): `forge check`
  on `conformance/sum.th` and `conformance/binary_search.th` still certify L3
  (the cache changes performance, not verdict — AC-1/REQ-2), and the golden
  `conformance/sum.cert.json` STILL deserializes into the `Certificate` struct
  with the new `cached` field (`#[serde(default)]`; the golden omits it). The
  cert-oracle deterministic-subset comparison is unchanged (`cached` and
  `solver_time_ms` excluded).

## Architecture

`forge/src/cache.rs` is a thin, deterministic, content-addressed store with no
verification logic of its own — it sits BETWEEN `check::item_subprogram` /
`thermite_lower::lower` (which produce the lowered source) and `check::run_verus`
(the solver invocation it lets `forge` skip on a hit). It depends on `sha2` for
the stable hash (see "Dependency note" below).

**The cache key (REQ-1).** The content address for one item is

```text
key = sha256( DOMAIN ||                        // "thermite.forge.proof-cache.v1"
        len-prefix( lowered_verus_source )  ||   // what verus checks (REQ-1a)
        len-prefix( seed_bytes )            ||   // pinned solver seed (REQ-1b, §5.3)
        len-prefix( verus_version )         ||   // REQ-1d / REQ-5
        len-prefix( thermite_version )      ||   // REQ-1c / REQ-5
        len-prefix( effect_row.len() )      ||   // declared row, REQ-1e
        concat( len-prefix( token ) for token in effect_row ) ||
        len-prefix( CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION )       // check-logic version (#49 amendment)
      )
```

Each field is length-prefixed (and domain-tagged) before hashing so that, e.g.,
two distinct (source, version) splits cannot produce the same byte stream — the
hash is injective on the structured tuple, not merely on a flat concatenation.
The key is rendered as lowercase hex for the on-disk filename. The function is a
PURE function of its inputs: no wall-clock, no environment beyond the
explicitly-passed version strings and row (R-CODE-5).

**Why the key is COMPLETE — the soundness argument (REQ-2).** A cache hit must
be indistinguishable from a fresh verus run. The verdict for an item is a
deterministic function of exactly: what verus is asked to prove (the lowered
Verus source — the §5.3 isolated sub-program, including every `spec fn` the
item's contract references), the seed the SMT solver is pinned to
(`smt.random_seed`, §5.3), and the prover itself (the verus version, which fixes
Z3/the encoding) plus the thermite lowering that produced the source (the
thermite version). Nothing else influences the verdict: there is no wall-clock,
no un-seeded randomness (`goal.md` R-CODE-5), no ambient state.

The stored artifact is a certificate, and one of its oracle fields is determined
outside that set: `effects` comes from the item's declared row, which lowering
erases for every label but `diverge`. Input (e) closes the gap by keying on the
same token vector the certificate carries. Therefore if all key inputs are equal,
both the solver outcome and the certificate's oracle fields are equal, and the
cached certificate is what a fresh run would produce. Conversely, if ANY of them
differs, the key differs and `forge` re-verifies. The argument's load-bearing
claim is the ENUMERATION: these five plus the check-logic version are ALL the
inputs determining an oracle field. The lowered
source is the right content-address (not the surface AST) precisely because it
is *what verus checks* — two surface programs that lower to the same Verus bytes
have the same verdict, and a surface change that does not alter the lowered bytes
cannot change the verdict (see OQ-3).

**The lookup/store flow (REQ-3).** Inside `check::check_file`'s existing per-item
loop, for an item on the L3 path (i.e. not a `#[slag]` L1 short-circuit and not a
triage reject — those never reach verus, so there is nothing to cache):

```text
sub      = item_subprogram(item, &spec_items)        // §5.3 isolated sub-program
lowered  = thermite_lower::lower(&sub)
row      = item_effects(item)                              // the declared row (REQ-1e)
key      = cache::key(&lowered, seed, &verus_version, &thermite_version, &row)   // REQ-1
match cache::load(&key) {
  Some(stored) => stored.with_cached(true),          // HIT: skip verus (REQ-3, AC-1)
  None => {
    verus = run_verus(&sub, &lowered, seed)           // MISS: the solver runs
    cert  = assemble_certificate(item, &verus)
    cache::store(&key, &cert)                          // store for next time
    cert.with_cached(false)
  }
}
```

`cache.rs` exposes the boundary surface (as-built spellings):
`pub fn cache_key(lowered_src, seed, verus_version, thermite_version, effect_row) -> String`,
`pub fn load(cache_dir, key) -> Option<Certificate>`,
`pub fn store(cache_dir, key, cert) -> std::io::Result<()>`, and
`pub fn default_cache_dir() -> PathBuf`; its sole
non-test production consumer is `check::check_file`. The verus-version string is
captured once per `check_file` invocation (`verus --version`, REQ-5) and the
thermite version is `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` of the `forge` crate.

**Cache location + format (REQ-6).** Entries live under
`target/thermite-proof-cache/<hex-key>.json`, each a `serde_json` serialization
of the stored `Certificate`. The directory is build output — git-ignorable and
NEVER committed (a `target/` entry already exists in workspace ignores; the
proof-cache dir is under `target/`, so it inherits the ignore — the builder
confirms/adds the `.gitignore` line). A corrupt or unparseable entry is a MISS:
`load` returns `None` (re-verify + overwrite on store), never an error and never
a stale read — a damaged cache degrades to "slower," never to "wrong" or
"crashes" (R-CODE-2: no panic; the IO error path returns `None`/`Ok(())`).

**The additive `cached` field (REQ-7).** `manifest::Certificate` gains
`#[serde(default)] pub cached: bool`, mirroring the #6 `slag_meta`/`reject`
additive precedent (`manifest.rs`): the frozen golden `sum.cert.json` (no
`cached` key) still deserializes (defaulting `false`), and `cached` is NOT in
`Certificate::oracle_subset` — because a hit and a fresh verify MUST compare
oracle-equal (REQ-2), `cached` describes provenance, never verdict. A
`Certificate::with_cached(bool)` builder sets it. `cli::render_human` may surface
it for observability; `--json` carries it for the soundness test.

**Determinism + version-keying (REQ-8, REQ-5).** The certificate is
bit-reproducible on its deterministic subset given identical (lowered source,
seed, verus version, thermite version) — the same tuple that forms the key. A
HIT returns the stored cert's deterministic fields unchanged and sets
`cached: true`; `solver_time_ms` reports the stored value (oracle-excluded
either way — see OQ-2). A verus or thermite upgrade changes the version inputs,
hence the key, hence forces a universal re-verify — the cache cannot serve a
certificate proved by a different prover than the one now installed (REQ-5,
guarding against a stale-prover false-L3).

**Boundaries (documented, attributed).**
- Compiled-BINARY bit-reproducibility (the rustc/Cargo machine-code output) is
  OUT of scope — that is the Rust toolchain's concern, not `forge`'s. Issue #8 is
  VERIFICATION determinism + the proof cache, not codegen reproducibility
  (`thermite-design.md` §5.3 names "builds, formatting, codegen, and check
  results" as a family, but the codegen-byte guarantee is inherited from rustc,
  not implemented here).
- Cross-run proof-repair / background re-verify (driving L1/L2 back to L3
  unattended) is issue #18 / `thermite-design.md` §5.2, §13 v0.5 (`forge repair`)
  — NOT this component. The cache stores and returns the verdict it was given; it
  does not attempt to improve a stored non-L3 result.
- The full L3→L2→L1 degrade ladder + solver portfolio (issue #10) is OUT — the
  cache keys on whatever verdict `run_verus` produced under v0.1's binary
  level logic (`.design/forge/check.md` REQ-5).

## Verification

- `cargo test -p forge` — unit tests in `cache.rs`:
  - key purity / determinism (AC-4): `key(inputs) == key(inputs)`.
  - key completeness / invalidation (AC-2): each single-input perturbation
    (lowered source, seed, verus version, thermite version) changes the key.
  - locality (AC-3): `g`'s key is invariant under an `f`-only edit; `f`'s key
    changes. Computed from two `item_subprogram` lowerings of a two-item program.
  - round-trip store/load of a `Certificate`; a corrupt entry loads as `None`
    (REQ-6).
  - `cached` additivity (REQ-7 / AC-5): a `Certificate` with `cached: true`
    serializes the field; the golden `conformance/sum.cert.json` still
    deserializes with `cached` defaulting `false`; `oracle_subset` ignores
    `cached`.
- Conformance integration (`goal.md` model (B); the `conformance` route
  reference): `forge check conformance/sum.th` twice → 1st `cached:false`,
  2nd `cached:true` with an oracle-equal cert (AC-1); the verus-unavailable
  HIT test (AC-1, decisive solver-skip evidence); `sum`/`binary_search` still
  certify L3 (AC-5). Expected verdicts trace to `conformance/sum.cert.json` /
  `thermite-design.md`, never copied from `forge`'s own output (R-CHAR-3).
- `cargo clippy -p forge --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`,
  anti-pattern gate.

These conformance checks are the `goal.md` R-DEFER-6 gate that runs whenever a
commit touches `forge`.

**Dependency note.** This component adds `sha2 = "0.10"` to `forge/Cargo.toml`
(confirmed present in the cargo registry cache: `sha2-0.10.9`). The builder adds
the dependency; the doc-author does not edit `Cargo.toml`.

## Open questions

- OQ-1 (cache location): `target/thermite-proof-cache/` is the DECIDED location
  (build output, git-ignored via `target/`, project-local so a key collision
  across unrelated projects is impossible). The alternative `.thermite/cache/`
  (a dedicated dotdir, survives `cargo clean`) is recorded as the rejected
  option — `target/` was chosen so `cargo clean` clears the cache and the
  existing `target/` ignore covers it without a new `.gitignore` rule beyond a
  confirmation. Revisit if `forge` needs a cache that outlives `cargo clean`.
- OQ-2 (what `solver_time_ms` reports on a HIT): DECIDED — report the STORED
  value (the time the original proof took), not `0`. Rationale: it is
  oracle-excluded either way, so the choice does not affect any assertion; the
  stored value is the more honest datum ("this proof costs ~612ms when run") and
  `cached: true` already signals the time was not just incurred. `0` is the
  rejected alternative (it would understate the real proof cost). Either is
  sound; flagged because it is a visible field.
- OQ-3 (lowered-source hash vs surface-AST hash as the content address):
  DECIDED — hash the LOWERED Verus source, because that is *what verus checks*
  and therefore the true determinant of the verdict (REQ-1a / the soundness
  argument). A surface-AST hash would be UNSOUND if two distinct ASTs lower to
  identical Verus (they have the same verdict but different keys — merely a
  missed-hit, harmless) and, worse, risks being INCOMPLETE if the lowerer's
  output depends on anything not captured by the AST hash (e.g. a `spec fn`
  dependency pulled into the sub-program). Keying on the lowered bytes makes the
  key exactly track the verus input. This is the design's LEAST-settled call: it
  assumes `thermite_lower::lower` is itself deterministic given the AST
  (`.design/forge/check.md` REQ-7 asserts the pipeline is, and `lower` emits "in
  source order") — if that assumption ever fails, the cache key inherits the
  non-determinism and the invalidation tests (AC-4) would catch it.

## REQ status

| REQ | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-1 (cache-key composition) | SHIPPED | `cache::cache_key(lowered_src, seed, verus_version, thermite_version, effect_row) -> String` (`cache.rs`) sha256-hashes the five args PLUS the module-internal `CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION` check-logic version (= 7; the #49 amendment, bumped through `6 → 7` for the #269 arc), each DOMAIN-tagged + LENGTH-prefixed (`cache::field`); the row is fed as `effect-row-len` then one `effect` field per token; `sha2 = "0.10"` in `forge/Cargo.toml`. Consumer: `check::check_file` in `check.rs`, passing `check::item_effects(item)` — the same vector `assemble_certificate` writes to `Certificate::effects` (and, engine-wrapped, `engine::engine_cache_key`). |
| REQ-2 (soundness-completeness invariant) | SHIPPED | the key captures the five oracle-field-determining inputs (incl. the declared effect row, which determines `Certificate::effects` without reaching the lowered source; pinned by `divergence_cache_effect_row::cache_hit_effects_must_equal_a_fresh_verify` and `::editing_only_the_row_in_place_must_change_the_reported_effects`) PLUS the #49 check-logic version (a gate-set change forces a universal MISS — schema bumps 2–7 recorded at the const); the two verdict-changing knobs NOT in the key (`rlimit`, `mutation_floor`) BYPASS the cache at non-default values (`check_file`'s `use_cache` guard — neither served nor written). `cache::store` persists the canonical `cached: false` and `cache::load` returns it unchanged, so `check::check_file`'s HIT (`Certificate::with_cached(true)`) is oracle-equal to the fresh verify. Verified by `cache::tests::key_changes_when_any_input_changes` + `cache_conformance::second_run_is_a_cache_hit_with_equal_deterministic_fields`. |
| REQ-3 (lookup-then-store flow, per item) | SHIPPED | `check::check_file`'s L3 path calls `cache::load` BEFORE `run_verus` (HIT → return + skip verus + `continue`); on a MISS it runs verus, assembles + graduates the cert, `cache::store`s it, and returns `with_cached(false)`. Post-pin: a #13 `Certificate::rejected_vacuity` (computed inside the MISS branch) is stored too — a settled deterministic verdict, so a later HIT is verus-free end-to-end. |
| REQ-4 (locality — per-item) | SHIPPED | the key is over the item's OWN `item_subprogram` lowered source; `check::tests::cache_key_is_local_to_the_item` asserts `g`'s key is invariant under an `f`-only edit while `f`'s key changes. |
| REQ-5 (version-keyed invalidation) | SHIPPED | `check::resolve_verus_version` captures the verus version once per run (the `VERUS_VERSION` pin, else `verus --version`; a missing version is `ForgeError::VerusAbsent`, never an empty-string key) and `check::THERMITE_VERSION = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` feed the key. Verified by `cache::tests::key_changes_when_any_input_changes`. |
| REQ-6 (cache location + format) | SHIPPED | `cache::default_cache_dir()` = `target/thermite-proof-cache/` (under the already-ignored `target/`); one `<hex-key>.json` per key; `cache::store` writes atomically (temp + rename); a corrupt entry → `cache::load` returns `None` (`cache::tests::corrupt_entry_is_a_miss`). |
| REQ-7 (additive `cached: bool` field) | SHIPPED | `manifest::Certificate::cached` (`#[serde(default)]`, EXCLUDED from `oracle_subset`); `Certificate::with_cached` builder; the golden `sum.cert.json` still deserializes (`manifest::tests::cached_field_is_additive_and_oracle_excluded`). |
| REQ-8 (bit-reproducible cert) | SHIPPED | `cache::cache_key` is a PURE function of its four inputs (`cache::tests::cache_key_is_pure`); `cache::store`/`load` round-trip the deterministic fields (`cache::tests::round_trip_load_store`). |
