## Summary

Forge can build one L3 library from canonical Thermite lowering and authored
direct-Verus shell modules without exposing rich Rust types as a cross-crate
ABI. The selected Thermite functions may accept and return ADTs, references,
tuples, and bounded collections. They lower as `pub(crate)` and are callable by
the shell only because both sources are verified and compiled in the same
crate. Only explicitly selected link exports and public shell items cross the
crate boundary.

The combined source is not a second lowering. Forge takes the unchanged,
target-specific result of `lower_l3_library`, removes only its final `verus!`
delimiter, inserts each exact shell source in a deterministic module frame, and
restores that delimiter. One `verus --no-cheating --compile` invocation proves
and compiles those exact bytes. A distinct
`VerifiedCompositionReceiptV1`-schema receipt binds the Thermite input,
canonical lowering, exact shell files, complete item/type inventory, combined
source, proof evidence, artifact-codegen closure, and output rlib.

## User surface

The additive command is:

```text
forge build model.th --level l3 \
  --compose-export transition \
  --compose-shell platform_shell.rs \
  [--export primitive_link_export] \
  [--crate-name model_platform] \
  [--target std|kernel] \
  [--out dist/model.verified]
```

`--compose-export` and `--compose-shell` are repeatable and must occur together.
At least one composition export is required for this mode. `--export` retains
the issue-#101 primitive/unit public ABI and may be combined with composition
exports, but the same Thermite function cannot occupy both tiers. L1 behavior
and ordinary L3 build behavior are unchanged.

`forge verify-build <bundle> [--replay]` recognizes the receipt schema and
independently reconstructs the combined plan. Replay requires the recorded
Verus and artifact-codegen identities and reproduces the rlib digest.

## Visibility and closure

There are two distinct roots:

| Root kind | Lowered visibility | Admitted signature | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| link export | `pub` or total public wrapper | primitive scalars/unit | another crate |
| composition export | `pub(crate)` | full checked Thermite type language | direct-Verus shell in the same crate |

Every root participates in one union closure. Forge resolves and binds every
reachable executable function, specification function, ADT, generated bounded
type/helper, wrapper, caller edge, body, contract, and effect row. Slag,
boundaries, holes, unresolved calls, divergence, panic, hosted effects in a
kernel target, or any sub-L3 certificate reject the whole build.

For each composition export the plan records its semantic address, exact
signature, parameter ownership (`by_value`, `shared_borrow`, or
`exclusive_borrow`), return type, recursively closed type definitions, and
`crate` visibility. The composition inventory separately records Thermite,
generated, shell-module, and shell-item origins and visibility.

## Direct-Verus source policy

A shell file is a closed authored module body, not a crate or include tree.
Forge hashes its exact UTF-8 bytes and inventories each top-level function,
struct, enum, type, const, static, or trait. Module names and evidence paths are
canonicalized and sorted.

The shell policy rejects attributes, nested `verus!` invocations, nested or
external modules, declarations without checked bodies, `external_body`,
`assume`, `admit`, axioms, unsafe code, unchecked decreases, include macros,
unimplemented/todo markers, erasure bypasses, and macro definitions. Comments
and literals do not create false escape-hatch matches. This policy is checked
when planning and checked again from the bound files during receipt validation.

## Exact-source construction

The assembly algorithm is deterministic:

1. Parse, spec-check, effect-check, close, and canonically lower the frozen
   Thermite input for the selected target and visibility map.
2. Require the lowering to contain exactly one outer `verus!` block and no
   escape hatch.
3. Strip its final `}\n` only.
4. Append each shell as `pub mod <canonical_name> { use super::*; <exact bytes> }`.
5. Restore the final `}\n`, hash the combined source, and freeze the plan.
6. Re-read every input and repeat the complete assembly. Any byte difference
   rejects before proof.
7. Prove and compile the exact combined source once with
   `--no-cheating --compile`; source digests before and after Verus must equal
   the plan.

There is no shell-only proof, second Rust reconstruction, post-proof source
rewrite, or unbound artifact compilation.

## Deterministic rich-enum expansion

The pinned Verus release synthesizes `arrow_<field>` methods for a named enum
variant by iterating a randomly seeded `HashMap`. The methods are ghost
projection conveniences, but their process-random order is retained in
`lib.rmeta`. A four-field variant can therefore produce identical machine-code
members and different rlibs from the same exact source, defeating replay.
Verifier thread count, solver seed, source path remapping, and archive epoch do
not control this proc-macro hash seed.

For a library with a crate-visible composition export, canonical Thermite
lowering emits enum declarations through one Forge-owned item macro. Rust
expands the enum after the outer `verus!` syntax rewrite, and the expanded item
carries Verus's internal generated-item marker so its HIR remains part of the
checked crate. This preserves the authored enum, variant shapes, exhaustive
patterns, contracts, executable bodies, and the single exact-source
`verus --no-cheating --compile` invocation while bypassing only Verus's
randomized `arrow_*` convenience-method synthesis. The macro and marker are
present in the bound lowering and combined-source digests; they are never
inserted after the plan freezes.

Composition code destructures enum fields through exhaustive patterns. A
synthetic `value->field` projection on one of these delayed enums is not
admitted and therefore fails whole-crate verification instead of silently
reintroducing nondeterministic metadata. Ordinary L3 libraries without a
crate-visible composition export retain their existing direct enum lowering.

## Translation validation and proof completion

Ordinary contract, executable-expression, body, loop, and wrapper-guard TV
rows remain mandatory over the complete union closure. A divergent,
unverifiable, skipped, missing, duplicate, or injected non-pass row prevents
publication.

The scalar contract/exec/body TV obligation frames intentionally cannot spell a
rich ADT or tuple signature. For exactly those signature/frame refusals—and no
other refusal—the composition path completes the row from the conjunction of:

- the normalized Thermite AST and complete closure bound by the plan;
- the canonical target lowering bound byte-for-byte;
- the L3 function certificate for that same lowering; and
- the single whole-crate no-cheating proof and compilation.

The evidence row identifies this rich-state completion explicitly. It does not
convert an actual counterexample, timeout, unsupported body construct, missing
row, or non-rich skip into success. Fault-injected non-pass rows still reject.

## Kernel bounded-state representation

The kernel profile retains `#![no_std]` and `--no-vstd`. Because the distributed
vstd rlib depends on `std`, it is not linked into a kernel artifact. Forge now
explicitly imports the pinned, receipt-bound `vstd.vir` proof model and pairs it
with a deterministic erased `no_std` metadata rlib for the slice subset; the
architecture and replay boundary are specified in
`.design/build/kernel-byte-slice.md`. This enables native executable `&[u8]`
length/index operations with exact content contracts without introducing a
runtime adapter or allocator.

A kernel composition may still transport a bounded `Vec<T>` through rich state
and reason about its bounded length using an allocation-free length
representation. Element-observing or mutating `Vec` methods remain deliberately
absent in that target and therefore fail whole-crate verification. The hosted
target retains the full vstd-backed collection lowering. This is an
observable-subset refinement, not an unchecked allocator shim.

Forge promises a verified kernel rlib, not a freestanding final image with an
empty platform runtime. Larger ADT copies may leave target intrinsics such as
`memcpy` for the final linker. Selecting, verifying, receipt-binding, and
allowlisting that implementation belongs to the platform/TPL final-link gate;
the composition receipt does not substitute an unproved intrinsic body.

The acceptance probe uses `ProbeState { owner, generation, payload: Vec<u64> }`,
a typed `ProbeEvent`, and a `(ProbeState, ProbeAction)` result whose action has a
four-field `Store { owner, generation, slot, value }` variant. Its shell proves
the transition precondition, model/platform representation, action
authorization, and next-state simulation, then exports only a primitive
`boot_observation`. A host consumer observes the kernel rlib's result, and an
external rich-function consumer is rejected as private. Three independent
builds must have byte-identical receipts and rlibs, and replay must reproduce
the artifact digest.

## Receipt, validation, and publication

The bundle uses:

- plan schema `thermite.combined-artifact-plan.v1`;
- receipt schema `thermite.verified-composition-receipt.v1`;
- `evidence/lowered-thermite.verus.rs` for the canonical lowering;
- `evidence/direct-verus/*.rs` for exact authored shell bytes; and
- `evidence/source.verus.rs` for the exact combined compiler input.

The receipt composition binding commits to the lowering digest, canonical
shell-set digest, canonical inventory digest, and combined-source digest. The
ordinary source, parsed program, TV/certificate/Verus/toolchain evidence,
artifact and complete file inventory remain bound by the issue-#101 receipt
root. Validation rejects schema mixing, path traversal, missing/extra files,
semantic-plan drift, source-policy drift, visibility drift, toolchain drift,
and artifact drift.

Publication reuses the staging/fsync/self-validation/atomic-rename protocol.
No destination appears on any planning, policy, certificate, TV, proof,
codegen, binding, validation, or injected-fault failure.

Composition rejection diagnostics follow the shared structured-count rule in
`.design/build/verus-error-accounting.md`: a numeric `errors=N` claim appears
only when Verus supplies that field. A frontend rejection with an omitted count
remains a hard failure and publishes nothing, but is reported without a
fabricated sentinel value.

## Acceptance and adversarial matrix

- The ProbeState composition builds three byte-identical bundles, validates,
  replays, and reproduces its multi-field-enum rlib.
- The exact combined source contains one `verus!`, a `pub(crate)` rich root,
  and the exact planned shell bytes.
- A declared consumer observes the public shell result; a consumer naming the
  rich root fails privacy checking; final-image platform intrinsics remain a
  downstream receipt-bound TPL responsibility.
- Every receipt digest, inventory, source, shell, toolchain, and artifact is
  tamper-evident.
- Direct-Verus cheating tokens and declaration-only functions are rejected.
- Post-plan Thermite/lowering/shell/combined-source mutation is rejected.
- Missing, L0/L1/L2, timeout, counterexample, rejected, or failed-obligation
  certificates reject.
- Divergent, skipped, or unverifiable TV evidence rejects.
- Slag, boundary, hole, ignored executable, unsafe, axiom, external body, or
  unsupported kernel collection operation rejects without publication.
