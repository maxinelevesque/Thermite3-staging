## Summary

Every bare path naming a declared struct field in a type invariant lowers as a
field of the invariant predicate receiver. This rule applies through unary
expressions as well as binary expressions, calls, casts, field access, and
method calls. For example,
`keeps !panic_latched || !reschedule_pending` becomes
`!self.panic_latched || !self.reschedule_pending` inside
`well_formed(&self)`.

The solver-vacuity harness continues to consume the canonical lowered Verus
declaration. It does not maintain a second field-qualification pass. This keeps
the normal L3 artifact, `forge check`, and `forge battery` on one invariant
representation.

## Root cause

`lower_inv_expr` already rewrote a direct field path to `self.<field>` and
recursed through several compound expression nodes. It had no `Expr::Unary`
arm. A unary expression therefore reached the generic spec-expression lowerer,
which has no struct receiver context. Both paths below emitted bare names:

```text
Expr::Unary(Not, Path("panic_latched"))
    -> generic spec lowering
    -> !panic_latched
```

The solver-vacuity harness places the full lowered struct declaration in its
preamble. Verus elaborates that preamble before checking the synthetic
obligation, so the unresolved names stopped both vacuity queries before a
verdict. The same malformed predicate was present in the ordinary L3 lowering;
the vacuity gate exposed it first.

## Decision

`lower_inv_expr` owns struct-field receiver binding. Its unary arm:

1. recursively lowers the operand with the same field-name and string-field
   context;
2. emits Verus's type-directed `!` operator;
3. preserves grouping for a binary operand.

This is the smallest shared correction. Qualifying text while building a
vacuity harness would create a harness-only interpretation and leave the normal
artifact malformed. Rewriting source identifiers by string replacement would
also lose AST boundaries and could alter unrelated names.

## Verification

The hand-authored issue reproduction lives at
`conformance/struct-invariant-receiver/repro.th`. Its postcondition leaves
`panic_latched` unconstrained, so the current mutation floor correctly returns a
structured `WeakContract` verdict after the vacuity harnesses elaborate. The
companion `accept.th` adds the missing preservation postcondition while retaining
the same unary struct invariant.

- Lowerer conformance checks that the emitted `well_formed` predicate contains
  both `self`-qualified fields and passes the real Verus binary.
- Forge conformance runs `forge check <repro> --level l3` and requires the
  post-vacuity `WeakContract` certificate, with no unresolved-name diagnostic.
- Forge conformance runs `forge check <accept> --level l3` and requires a clean
  L3 certificate for `clear`.
- Forge conformance runs `forge battery <accept> clear` and requires a successful
  battery rendering after all solver-vacuity queries elaborate.
- Existing ADT lowering, solver-vacuity, formatting, lint, requirement, and
  documentation gates remain green.
