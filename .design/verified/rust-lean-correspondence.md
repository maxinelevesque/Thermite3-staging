# Rust↔Lean Encoder Correspondence — the arm-by-arm audit-by-inspection

<!--
tier: 3-component

governs: thermite-tv/src/{ref_encode,exec_encode,exec_stmt_encode}.rs  (the Rust reference
         encoders that RUN in the per-run TV) ↔ lean/Thermite/{RefEncode,Exec}.lean +

## Summary

The Lean proof spine proves the reference-encoder *algorithm* is denotation-faithful
(`Thermite.ref_sound`, `Thermite.Exec.exec_ref_sound`, `Thermite.Exec.body_ref_sound`,
composed in `Thermite.lowering_faithful`). But Lean proves the **Lean** definitions sound;
that the **Rust** encoders in `thermite-tv/` (which actually run in the per-run TV) implement
the *same* algorithm is a separate claim, discharged today by inspection. This document makes
that inspection rigorous and complete: an arm-by-arm map, every row showing the actual Rust
match arm / format string beside the actual Lean definition arm, plus the Verus-meaning bridge
and the Lean theorem (and negative lemma) that pins it. It also enumerates honestly what the
inspection does and does NOT cover, and what the stronger extraction-bridge tier would add.

## The claim being audited

> **(CORR)** For every construct in the frozen subset, the Rust encoder's emitted Verus text
> has — under Verus's documented expression semantics — exactly the denotation the corresponding
> Lean model assigns to that construct.

The trust reduction this closes:

```
  {Lean-proven encoder ALGORITHM}      — ref_sound / exec_ref_sound / body_ref_sound
+ {this Rust↔Lean correspondence}      — CORR, by arm-by-arm inspection (THIS DOC)
+ {per-run Z3 translation validation}  — h_tv: ⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦ref(P)⟧, discharged per run
= the UNIVERSAL faithfulness               per Thermite.lowering_faithful (Faithfulness.lean)
```

`lowering_faithful` consumes a `FnTvWitness` whose `h_tv_contract`/`h_tv_body` are the Z3
attestations that the **Rust** `ref(P)` agrees with the production lowering. The theorem then
composes that with the Lean (T1) theorems. CORR is the bridge that lets the theorem about the
**Lean** `refDenote`/`execRefValue`/`bodyRefState` carry over to the **Rust** `ref_contract_pred`
/`exec_ref_value`/`body_ref_state` that produced the string Z3 actually saw.

Lean toolchain: `leanprover/lean4:v4.29.0` (downgraded from v4.30.0 by the #184 Z3-demotion probe — `lean/lakefile.toml` now `[[require]]`s Lean-SMT + Mathlib; this is OUTSIDE the `lean/Thermite/**` audited-spine scope and the entire audited spine still builds green and `sorry`-free on v4.29.0 — see `.design/verified/z3-demotion.md` and Amendment 2026-06-10).
Verified `sorry`-free by inspection: every `sorry` token in the tree is inside a comment, never in
a proof term (the proofs close by `simp`/`omega`/`decide`/`rfl`/structural induction). The spine's
axiom footprint is the standard `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (per the #182/#174 commit
messages and the `Faithfulness.lean` header). **Any edit to a pinned encoder file invalidates the
corresponding table section and requires re-audit (see "Drift" below).**

## Requirements

- **REQ-1 (the arm-by-arm correspondence map)** — for every arm of each Rust reference encoder,
  exhibit the Rust source (the match arm / format string), the corresponding Lean model arm, the
  one-line Verus-meaning bridge, and the pinning Lean theorem (+ negative lemma where one exists).
  Derived from `thermite-semantics.md` REQ-6 (the correspondence residual). The deliverable IS this
  doc's tables.
- **REQ-2 (the extraction bridge — the stronger tier)** — a mechanized Lean→Rust extraction (or a
  Rust-side proof) that would make the Rust encoder equal the Lean model by construction rather than
  by inspection. NOT in this doc's scope; the named future closure of the same residual.

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (completeness)** — every match arm of `ref_contract_pred`/`exec_ref_value`/`body_ref_state`
  (and the combinator registry `verus_l3` forms the encoders reference) appears as a row, OR is
  recorded as an explicit out-of-Lean-scope residual in "What this inspection does NOT cover."
  The `ref_encode.rs::encode` dispatch is enumerated exhaustively in Table 1H (all 15 arms). Two of
  its live arms — `Expr::Field` (struct-field access `result.x`) and `Expr::TupleProj` (tuple
  projection `result.0`) — have NO Lean `Expr` constructor and are recorded as the explicit
  out-of-Lean-scope residual **Discrepancy D6** (inspection-only, like the Map accessor D3 and the
  guard-arm path D4); they are NOT correspondence rows, because no correspondence exists to claim.
  The leaf arms (`IntLit`/`BoolLit`/`Path`) ARE rowed (Table 1H) with their Lean `intLit`/`boolLit`/
  `var` counterparts. The catch-all `Err` arm is the faithful out-of-`S_C` boundary. So every live
  `encode` arm is now a row OR an explicitly-listed residual — AC-1 is true, not merely asserted.
- **AC-2 (groundedness)** — every row quotes the actual Rust arm and the actual Lean arm (short exact
  excerpts), never a paraphrase. A row that cannot be grounded is a discrepancy, recorded in
  "Discrepancies found."
- **AC-3 (the bridge assumptions are enumerated)** — the inspection's own trust items (Verus
  semantics, fuel↔well-founded unfolding, the symbolic-env↔big-step-transformer assumption) are
  listed.
- **AC-4 (the residuals are honest)** — string-level formatting, the production lowerer (out of
  scope — that is what TV is for), loops (#163), and the extraction-bridge tier are named as
  uncovered.

## How to read a correspondence row

Each row has four cells:

1. **Rust arm** — `file` symbol + the quoted match arm or `format!` string.
2. **Lean arm** — `file` symbol + the quoted Lean definition arm.
3. **Verus-meaning bridge** — one line: why, under Verus's documented semantics, the emitted string
   denotes what the Lean arm says.
4. **Pinned by** — the Lean theorem that proves the Lean arm sound, and the negative lemma (if one
   exists) proving the choice is load-bearing.

A skeptic verifies a row by reading the two quoted arms and confirming the emitted token/shape
matches the Lean datum, then checking the bridge line against Verus's precedence/operator rules.

## Table 1 — `thermite-tv/src/ref_encode.rs` ↔ `lean/Thermite/RefEncode.lean`

### 1A. The binary-operator map (`binop_str`) ↔ `encOp`/`encLog`/`encArith` + `encode_unary`

Rust `binop_str` (`ref_encode.rs`) is a single 18-arm `match`. Lean splits it into three total
maps (`encOp` comparisons, `encLog` logical, `encArith` arithmetic) plus `encode_unary`→`neg`.
The token each emits is interpreted by `tokRel`/`tokConn`/`tokArith` (RefEncode.lean).

| # | Rust arm (`binop_str`) | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Eq | `BinOp::Eq => "=="` | `encOp \| CmpOp.eq => VerusCmpTok.eqTok`; `tokRel eqTok x y => x = y` | Verus `==` on two ints is `=` | `ref_sound` (cmp case); neg: `eq_le_infidelity_breaks_soundness` |
| Ne | `BinOp::Ne => "!="` | `encOp \| CmpOp.ne => neTok`; `tokRel neTok => x ≠ y` | Verus `!=` is `≠` | `ref_sound` |
| Lt | `BinOp::Lt => "<"` | `encOp \| CmpOp.lt => ltTok`; `tokRel ltTok => x < y` | Verus `<` is `<` | `ref_sound` |
| Le | `BinOp::Le => "<="` | `encOp \| CmpOp.le => leTok`; `tokRel leTok => x ≤ y` | Verus `<=` is `≤` | `ref_sound`; neg: `eq_le_infidelity_breaks_soundness` |
| Gt | `BinOp::Gt => ">"` | `encOp \| CmpOp.gt => gtTok`; `tokRel gtTok => x > y` | Verus `>` is `>` | `ref_sound` |
| Ge | `BinOp::Ge => ">="` | `encOp \| CmpOp.ge => geTok`; `tokRel geTok => x ≥ y` | Verus `>=` is `≥` | `ref_sound` |
| And | `BinOp::And => "&&"` | `encLog \| LogOp.and => andTok`; `tokConn andTok p q => p ∧ q` | Verus `&&` is `∧` | `ref_sound` (logic case) |
| Or | `BinOp::Or => "\|\|"` | `encLog \| LogOp.or => orTok`; `tokConn orTok => p ∨ q` | Verus `\|\|` is `∨` | `ref_sound` |
| Not | `encode_unary`: `UnaryOp::Not => Ok(format!("(!{i})"))` | `refDenote \| Expr.neg e => ¬ refDenote …` | Verus `(!p)`, parenthesized, is `¬` | `ref_sound` (neg case) |
| Add | `BinOp::Add => "+"` | `encArith \| add => plusTok`; `tokArith plusTok => arithDenote add` | Verus `+` (spec int) is `+` | `ref_sound` (via `refVal_eq`); `tokArith_encArith` |
| Sub | `BinOp::Sub => "-"` | `encArith \| sub => minusTok` → `arithDenote sub` | `-` | `tokArith_encArith` |
| Mul | `BinOp::Mul => "*"` | `encArith \| mul => starTok` → `arithDenote mul` | `*` | `tokArith_encArith` |
| Div | `BinOp::Div => "/"` | `encArith \| div => slashTok` → `arithDenote div` | `/` (nonzero-divisor precond, source-side) | `tokArith_encArith` |
| Rem | `BinOp::Rem => "%"` | `encArith \| rem => percentTok` → `arithDenote rem` | `%` (nonzero precond) | `tokArith_encArith` |
| Shl | `BinOp::Shl => "<<"` | `encArith \| shl => shlTok` → `arithDenote shl` | `<<` = `* 2^k` | `tokArith_encArith` |
| Shr | `BinOp::Shr => ">>"` | `encArith \| shr => shrTok` → `arithDenote shr` | `>>` = `/ 2^k` | `tokArith_encArith` |
| BitAnd | `BinOp::BitAnd => "&"` | `encArith \| bitAnd => ampTok` → `arithDenote bitAnd` | `&` (Nat.land on bounded operands) | `tokArith_encArith` |
| BitOr | `BinOp::BitOr => "\|"` | `encArith \| bitOr => pipeTok` → `arithDenote bitOr` | `\|` (Nat.lor) | `tokArith_encArith` |
| BitXor | `BinOp::BitXor => "^"` | `encArith \| bitXor => caretTok` → `arithDenote bitXor` | `^` (Nat.xor) | `tokArith_encArith` |

Both sides wholly parenthesize a binary: Rust `encode_binary` returns `format!("({l} {} {r})", binop_str(op))`;
the Lean `refIntVal Expr.arith` is `tokArith (encArith op) (refIntVal a) (refIntVal b)` (operands bound
first, so the parens make the Rust string parse to that same AST). This is the bridge for every binary row.

**The Eq nat-coercion via `encode_binary`'s `is_nat_valued`.** Rust `encode_binary` applies the
`as nat` coercion **only on `Eq`** (`let coerce = op == BinOp::Eq;` then `is_nat_valued(rhs)` /
`is_nat_valued(lhs)`). `is_nat_valued` is `matches!(expr, Expr::Call { callee, .. } if … Expr::Path(_))`
— a nat-returning spec-fn/`count_where` call. The Lean side does NOT model the `as nat` coercion
string explicitly; it routes both operands through `refIntVal`/`castDenote` over the shared `Int`
domain, where `castDenote CastTy.nat v = (v.toNat : Int)` and the `≥ 0` source frame makes the clamp
the identity. **This is the one place the Lean model abstracts a Rust string detail** — see
Discrepancy D1 (it is a sound abstraction, not a mismatch).

### 1B. Casts — `encode_cast`/`cast_target` ↔ `encCast`/the `cast` arm (#122 / #146)

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `as u32` | `cast_target`: `Type::Prim(PrimType::U32) => Ok("u32")` | `encCast \| CastTy.u32 => u32Tok`; `tokCast u32Tok => castDenote CastTy.u32` (identity on int domain) | `as u32` on spec int (no-overflow frame) is value-preserving | `tokCast_encCast`; `ref_sound` (via `refVal_eq` cast) |
| `as u64` | `Type::Prim(PrimType::U64) => Ok("u64")` | `encCast \| CastTy.u64 => u64Tok` → `castDenote u64` | value-preserving | `tokCast_encCast` |
| `as usize` | `Type::Prim(PrimType::Usize) => Ok("usize")` | `encCast \| CastTy.usize => usizeTok` → `castDenote usize` | value-preserving | `tokCast_encCast` |
| `as nat` | `Type::Named(n) if n == "nat" \| n == "int" => Ok(n.clone())` (nat) | `encCast \| CastTy.nat => natTok` → `castDenote nat = (v.toNat:Int)` | `as nat` injects into ℕ; `≥0` source frame makes clamp the identity | `tokCast_encCast` |
| `as int` | same arm (int) | `encCast \| CastTy.int => intTok` → `castDenote int = v` | `as int` is the spec int, identity | `tokCast_encCast` |
| cast→bool | `PrimType::Bool => Err(Unsupported("cast to bool …"))` | (absent — `CastTy` has no `bool`) | OUT of `S_C`; honest `Err` | n/a (out of scope, faithfully) |
| **#122 inner-paren** | `encode_cast`: `Ok(format!("({e}) as {target}"))` — inner wrapped UNCONDITIONALLY | `refIntVal Expr.cast inner ty => tokCast (encCast ty) (refIntVal fuel inner env)` — cast binds the WHOLE inner | the `({e})` paren makes a compound inner (`a + b`) bind as a unit so `(a+b) as nat` ≠ `a + (b as nat)` | neg: `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness` (Soundness.lean) |
| **#146 outer-paren** | `is_lt_leading`: `matches!(op, BinOp::Lt \| Le \| Shl)`; `encode_binary_operand` wraps a `Cast` left of such op: `if is_left && matches!(operand, Expr::Cast{..}) && is_lt_leading(op) { Ok(format!("({s})")) }` | (modelled at the AST level: the Lean cast denotes the whole inner; the outer paren is a *parse-safety* property of the string, not a denotation change) | `(x as u32) < 33` avoids the `u32<` generic-args mis-parse; both sides denote the same `<` over the cast value | `tokCast_encCast` + the #122 neg lemma; the #146 outer-paren is a parse-safety guarantee (see Bridge Assumption A1 / Discrepancy D2) |

The `#122` negative lemma `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness` constructs `castInnerFaithful` vs
`castInnerParenDropped` and proves the dropped-paren encoder disagrees with the source at a witness
env — proving the Rust `format!("({e}) as {target}")` paren is load-bearing.

### 1C. Slice/index/ref rewrites — `encode_slice_arg`/`encode_index`/`encode_ref` ↔ `refSeqVal` arms (#178)

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| slice `@`-view | `encode_slice_arg`: bare `Expr::Path` not seq-bound → `Ok(format!("{}@", segments[0]))`; seq-bound → identity `encode(arg)` | `refSeqVal \| Expr.seqVar x, env => env.seqs x` (the `@`-view is identity on the value) | `xs@` is the `Seq` view of slice `xs`; same element sequence | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal`; `ref_sound` |
| single index | `encode_index` `IndexArg::Single(i)`: `Ok(format!("{recv}[{idx}]"))` over `encode_receiver`'s `@`-view; `idx = encode_index_value(i)` (`<p> as int` / bare literal) | `refIntVal \| Expr.idx base i => byteView encByteAt (refSeqVal base) (refIntVal i)` (`byteView specByteAt s i = seqIdx s i`) | `xs@[i as int]` is the i-th element of the view | `byteView_encByteAt`; `ref_sound`; neg: `byteview_wrong_index_breaks_soundness` |
| `&xs[..i]` (RangeTo) | `encode_index` `RangeTo(hi)`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.subrange(0, {h})"))` (via `encode_ref`→`encode_index`) | `refSeqVal \| Expr.subrange base (RangeArg.rangeTo hi) => seqSub s 0 (refIntVal hi)` | `xs@.subrange(0,i)` is the prefix `seqSub 0 i` | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal`; `subrange_index_faithful_matches_source` |
| `&xs[a..b]` (Range) | `Range(lo,hi)`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.subrange({l}, {h})"))` | `RangeArg.range lo hi => seqSub s (refIntVal lo) (refIntVal hi)` | `xs@.subrange(a,b)` = `seqSub a b` | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` |
| `&xs[a..]` (RangeFrom) | `RangeFrom(lo)`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.subrange({l}, {recv}.len() as int)"))` | `RangeArg.rangeFrom lo => seqSub s (refIntVal lo) (s.length : Int)` | `xs@.subrange(a, xs@.len())` = `seqSub a |s|` | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` |
| bare `&xs` | `encode_ref`: `Expr::Path(_) => encode_slice_arg(inner)` | (the slice `@`-view above) | `&xs` over a spec slice is the `@`-view (no Verus `&Seq`) | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` |
| `&e` (other) | `encode_ref` `other => Err(Unsupported)` | (absent) | OUT of `S_C`; honest `Err` | n/a |

### 1D. String byte-view — `encode_string_byteview`/`encode_method_call` ↔ `byteView`/`encByteAt`/`encLen` (#127)

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `s.byte_at(i)` (String) | `encode_string_byteview` `"byte_at"`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.spec_byte_at({idx})"))` (literal bare; else `as int`) | `refIntVal \| Expr.byteAt base i => byteView encByteAt (refSeqVal base) (refIntVal i)`; `encByteAt = specByteAt`; `byteView specByteAt s i = seqIdx s i` | `s.spec_byte_at(i)` is the i-th byte | `byteView_encByteAt`; neg: `byteview_misdispatch_breaks_soundness`, `byteview_wrong_index_breaks_soundness` |
| `s.len()` (String) | `encode_string_byteview` `"len"`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.spec_len()"))` | `refIntVal \| Expr.seqLen base => byteView encLen (refSeqVal base) 0`; `encLen = specLen`; `byteView specLen s _ = (s.length:Int)` | `s.spec_len()` is the byte-sequence length | `byteView_encLen` |
| `xs.len()` (slice) | `encode_method_call` `"len"`: `recv = encode_len_receiver(receiver)` (BARE path) → `Ok(format!("{recv}.len()"))` | same `Expr.seqLen` arm (length of view) | a slice `.len()` in spec position is the seq length | `byteView_encLen` |
| `xs[i]` byte-view (Seq recv) | `encode_method_call` `"byte_at"` (non-string recv): `recv = encode_receiver(..)` (@-view); `Ok(format!("{recv}[{idx}]"))` | `Expr.byteAt`/`Expr.idx` (same `seqIdx`) | `recv@[i]` is the i-th element | `byteView_encByteAt` |
| `s.slice(lo,hi)` | `encode_method_call` `"slice"`: `Ok(format!("{recv}.subrange({lo}, {hi})"))` | `Expr.subrange`/`seqSub` (see 1C) | `recv@.subrange(lo,hi)` | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` |
| `.slice` on String | `encode_string_byteview` `other => Err(Unsupported)` | (absent) | OUT; `TString` has no `spec_slice` | n/a (faithful absence) |
| other spec method | `encode_method_call` `other => Err(Unsupported)` | (absent) | OUT of frozen byte-view set | n/a |

The #127 negative lemma `byteview_misdispatch_breaks_soundness` proves routing `byte_at` to the
length spec-fn (the name-collision bug) disagrees with the faithful denotation — pinning that the
Rust dispatch CHOICE (`byte_at`→`spec_byte_at`, `len`→`spec_len`) is the load-bearing content.

The **Map accessor** (`encode_map_accessor`: `contains_key`→`spec_contains_key`, `len`→`len`) and
the **Option/Result frame** that #150 added to `RefCtx` are **NOT modelled in Lean** — see
Discrepancy D3 (Map membership is a residual; it is not in the Lean `S_C` fragment).

### 1E. The 8 combinators — `encode_combinator_call`/`encode_combinator_arg`/`encode_pred_arg`/`encode_index_value` ↔ the `comb` arms + `countWhereVal`/`permEq`

The Rust `encode_combinator_call` REUSES the registry name and re-encodes args **per
`CombinatorSig.arg_kinds`** (the frozen `thermite-spec/src/combinators.rs` `verus_l3` is the shared
ground truth on both Rust and production sides). Lean `refDenote Expr.comb` reproduces each
combinator's frozen `verus_l3` quantifier body directly.

| Combinator | Frozen `verus_l3` (combinators.rs) | Lean arm (`refDenote`/`refIntVal`) | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `forall_in(s,p)` | `forall\|i:int\| 0<=i<s.len() ==> #[trigger] p(s[i])` | `CombName.forallIn => ∀ i, (0≤i ∧ i<s.length) → p i` | `ref_sound` (comb); neg: `wrong_combinator_breaks_soundness` |
| `exists_in(s,p)` | `exists\|i:int\| 0<=i<s.len() && #[trigger] p(s[i])` | `CombName.existsIn => ∃ i, (0≤i ∧ i<s.length) ∧ p i` | `ref_sound`; neg: `wrong_combinator_breaks_soundness` |
| `sorted(s)` | `forall\|i,j\| 0<=i<=j<s.len() ==> s[i]<=s[j]` | `CombName.sorted => ∀ i j, (0≤i ∧ i≤j ∧ j<s.length) → seqIdx s i ≤ seqIdx s j` | `ref_sound` |
| `forall_below(s,n,p)` | `forall\|i\| 0<=i<n && i<s.len() ==> #[trigger] p(s[i])` | `CombName.forallBelow => ∀ i, (0≤i ∧ i<n ∧ i<s.length) → p i` | `ref_sound`; neg: `index_argkind_slice_view_breaks_soundness` (#145) |
| `forall_from(s,n,p)` | `forall\|i\| n<=i<s.len() ==> #[trigger] p(s[i])` | `CombName.forallFrom => ∀ i, (n≤i ∧ i<s.length) → p i` | `ref_sound` |
| `disjoint(a,b)` | `forall\|i,j\| (0<=i<a.len() && 0<=j<b.len()) ==> a[i]!=b[j]` | `CombName.disjoint => ∀ i j, (… ) → seqIdx s i ≠ seqIdx s2 j` | `ref_sound` |
| `count_where(s,p)` | `if s.len()==0 {0} else {(if p(s[0]){1}else{0})+count_where(s.drop_first(),p)}` | `refIntVal Expr.comb countWhere … => countWhereVal p s`; `countWhereVal (x::xs) = (ite (p x) 1 0) + countWhereVal p xs` | `count_where_*` lemmas; neg: `count_where_wrong_pred_breaks_soundness`, `count_where_off_by_one_breaks_soundness` |
| `permutation_of(a,b)` | `a.to_multiset() == b.to_multiset()` | `CombName.permutationOf => permEq s s2`; `permEq a b = ∀ x, a.count x = b.count x` | `permutation_*`; neg: `permutation_set_model_breaks_soundness` |

The three **arg-kinds** (the `encode_combinator_arg` dispatch on `thermite_spec::ArgKind`):

| ArgKind | Rust arm (`encode_combinator_arg`) | Lean threading | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Slice` | `ArgKind::Slice => encode_slice_arg(arg)` (the `@`-view) | `let s := refSeqVal fuel seq env` | `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` |
| `Index` | `ArgKind::Index => encode_index_value(arg)` (scalar `<p> as int`, NEVER `@`-view — #145) | `let n := match idx with \| some e => refIntVal fuel e env` | neg: `index_argkind_slice_view_breaks_soundness` |
| `Pred` | `ArgKind::Pred => encode_pred_arg(arg)`: `Ok(format!("\|{}: u32\| {body_s}", params[0]))` | `let p := fun i => refDenote fuel body (env.bindInt bound (seqIdx s i))` | `ref_sound` (recursive IH on body) |
| `Value` | `ArgKind::Value => encode(arg)` | (no combinator in the frozen set uses `Value`; absent) | n/a |

The Rust `encode_pred_arg` binds the closure param at `u32` (`format!("|{}: u32| {body_s}")`); Lean
`Pred.mk bound body` binds via `Env.bindInt bound (seqIdx s i)`. Both apply the body at the i-th
element. The `wrong_combinator_breaks_soundness` (forallIn↔existsIn) and the `#145`
`index_argkind_slice_view_breaks_soundness` are the load-bearing negative lemmas here.

### 1F. Match / `is` — `encode_match`/`encode_pattern`/`is_builtin_variant` + the `Expr::Is` arm ↔ `denoteArms`/`refDenoteArms`/`is_` (#180)

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `match scrut { … }` | `encode_match`: `format!("match {s} {{\n")` … each arm `{pat} => {body}` (scrutinee + each body by `encode`) | `refDenote Expr.match_ scrut arms => refDenoteArms fuel (scrutVal scrut env) arms env` | Verus `match` selects the arm by variant (encoder reuses Verus match) | `ref_sound`+`ref_sound_arms`; neg: `match_arm_swap_breaks_soundness` |
| arm select+bind | `encode_match` arm loop; pattern via `encode_pattern` | `refDenoteArms \| MatchArm.mk variant binder body :: rest => if scrut.variant = variant then (match binder …) else refDenoteArms … rest` | arm chosen by variant; payload bound | `ref_sound_arms` |
| `Some(x)`/`Ok(x)`/`Err(e)`/`None` patterns | `encode_pattern` `Pattern::Enum` + `is_builtin_variant(head)`: `matches!(head, "Some"\|"None"\|"Ok"\|"Err")` | `Variant.{some_,none_,ok,err}` + `MatchArm.mk variant binder body` | built-in Option/Result, unqualified in Verus | `ref_sound_arms`; `match_result_faithful_is_sound` |
| user variant | `encode_pattern`: `if !is_builtin_variant(head) { Err(Unsupported) }` | (absent — `Variant` has only the 4 built-ins) | OUT of `S_C`; honest `Err` | n/a (faithful absence) |
| guard / wildcard / nested | `encode_pattern` `other => Err(Unsupported)`; `encode_match` guard arm `{pat} if {g} => …` | (Lean models only the 2-arm exhaustive built-in form; no guard arm) | guard arm is OUT of the modelled C7 fragment | see Discrepancy D4 |
| `scrut is Variant` | `Expr::Is` arm (`encode` in `ref_encode.rs`): `Ok(format!("({s} is {})", variant.join("::")))` | `refDenote Expr.is_ scrut variant => ((scrutVal scrut env).isVariant variant = true)` | Verus `(e is V)` discriminant test | `ref_sound` (is_ case); neg: `is_wrong_variant_breaks_soundness` |

### 1G. Spec-fn calls — `encode_call` case (3) ↔ the `specCall` arm + the fuel-indexed registry (#181)

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `old(x)` | `encode_call` case (1): `if name == "old" { … Ok(format!("old_{mangled}")) }` | (modelled as a free `var` — `old(x)` binds a distinct obligation param) | the obligation binds `old_x` as a value param | `ref_sound` (var case) |
| frozen combinator | `encode_call` case (2): `if thermite_spec::lookup(&name).is_some() { encode_combinator_call(..) }` | the `Expr.comb` arms (Table 1E) | dispatched to the registry `verus_l3` | (Table 1E) |
| named spec-fn call | `encode_call` case (3): `Ok(format!("{name}({})", encoded_args.join(", ")))` (NOT inlined) | `refDenote \| fuel+1, Expr.specCall name args, env => match env.specs name with \| some fn => refDenote fuel fn.body (env.bindParams fn.params (refIntValArgs (fuel+1) args env)) \| none => True` | the call is a Verus `spec fn` call; the body is lowered ONCE as its own `spec fn` | `ref_sound` (specCall case); neg: `specfn_arg_order_breaks_soundness`, `specfn_wrong_resolution_breaks_soundness` |
| per-arg encoding | `encode_call_arg`: `Closure => encode_pred_arg; other => encode_slice_arg` | `refIntValArgs \| a::rest => refIntVal fuel a env :: refIntValArgs fuel rest env` | each arg re-encoded (slice `@`-view / closure form) | `refIntValArgs_eq` |

The fuel index is the Lean modelling of Verus's well-founded `spec fn` unfolding (every Thermite
spec fn carries a mandatory `measures` measure, §4.2). The Rust encoder does NOT inline (it emits a call),
so there is no recursion to bound on the Rust side; the fuel models the *meaning* of the resulting
recursive spec-fn definition. See Bridge Assumption A2.

### 1H. The `encode` dispatch inventory (AC-1 completeness for `ref_encode.rs`)

The `ref_contract_pred`→`encode` `match` (`ref_encode.rs`) has 15 arms. AC-1 requires each to be a
row above OR an explicit residual. The full enumeration:

| `encode` arm | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `Expr::IntLit { value, .. } => Ok(value.to_string())` | leaf — Lean `Expr.intLit value`; the integer-literal denotation (`refIntVal Expr.intLit => value`). Pinned by `ref_sound` (intLit case). Benign, rowed here. |
| `Expr::BoolLit(b) => Ok(b.to_string())` | leaf — Lean `Expr.boolLit value`; the bool-literal denotation. Pinned by `ref_sound` (boolLit case). Benign, rowed here. |
| `Expr::Path(segments) => encode_path(..)` | the var leaf — Lean `Expr.var`/`Expr.seqVar`/`Expr.strVar`/`Expr.optResVar` (a free obligation param; `result`/`old(x)` are free names). Pinned by `ref_sound` (var case); the `old(x)` form is Table 1G row 1. |
| `Expr::Binary { op, lhs, rhs }` | Table 1A (the binop map + the Eq nat-coercion). |
| `Expr::Unary { op, expr }` | Table 1A (`Not`). |
| `Expr::Call { callee, args }` | Tables 1E (combinators) + 1G (`old`/named spec-fn calls). |
| `Expr::MethodCall { .. }` | Table 1D (byte-view / Map / slice `.len()`). |
| `Expr::Index { base, index }` | Table 1C. |
| `Expr::Ref { expr: inner, .. }` | Table 1C (the `&xs[..i]` / bare `&xs` slice-view rewrite). |
| `Expr::Cast { expr, ty }` | Table 1B. |
| `Expr::Field { receiver, name }` | **RESIDUAL — Discrepancy D6.** No Lean `Expr` constructor (`field`); struct-field access is OUTSIDE the Lean `S_C` fragment. Inspection-only. |
| `Expr::TupleProj { receiver, index }` | **RESIDUAL — Discrepancy D6.** No Lean `Expr` constructor (`tupleProj`); tuple-projection access is OUTSIDE the Lean `S_C` fragment. Inspection-only. |
| `Expr::Is { scrutinee, variant }` | Table 1F (last row). |
| `Expr::Match { scrutinee, arms }` | Table 1F. |
| `other => Err(RefEncodeError::Unsupported(node_kind(other)))` | the honest catch-all — every `Expr` variant NOT above (`Closure` outside a pred slot, `If`, `StructLit`, `Deref`, `StrLit`, `Tuple`) is a real `Err`, never a silent wrong encoding (faithful absence; out of `S_C`). |

Every live `encode` arm is now a row (Tables 1A–1G + the leaf rows here) OR an explicit residual
(`Field`/`TupleProj` → D6), and the catch-all `Err` is the faithful out-of-`S_C` boundary. AC-1 holds
for `ref_encode.rs`.

## Table 2 — `thermite-tv/src/exec_encode.rs` ↔ `lean/Thermite/Exec.lean`

The exec encoder is the BOUNDED dual: values carry the overflow obligation, casts WRAP at the target
width, and there is **no `nat`/`int`**. Lean `execDenote` is `Option ExecVal` (`none` = obligation
fails); `execRefValue` is the encoder model; `exec_ref_sound` proves them equal.

### 2A. The exec operator map (`binop_str`) ↔ `encArith`/`encCmp`/`encLog`

| Op class | Rust arm (`exec_encode.rs::binop_str`) | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| arithmetic (10) | `Add=>"+"` … `BitXor=>"^"` (identical 10 arms to Table 1A) | `encArith : AOp → ArithTok`; `tokArith tok a b : Option BVal` (overflow → `none` via `evalArith`) | exec `+` is the bounded add carrying the overflow obligation, NOT `wrapping_*` | `exec_ref_sound`; `tokArith_encArith`; neg: `nat_coercion_underflow_breaks_soundness` |
| comparison (6) | `Eq=>"=="` … `Ge=>">="` | `encCmp : COp → COp := id`; `cmpVal op a b : Bool` | exec comparison → `bool` | `exec_ref_sound` |
| logical (2) | `And=>"&&"`, `Or=>"\|\|"` | `encLog : LOp → LOp := id`; `logVal` | `&&`/`\|\|` over bool | `exec_ref_sound` |
| Not | `encode_unary`: `UnaryOp::Not => Ok(format!("(!{i})"))` | `ExecExpr.not e`; `execDenote .not => !v` | `(!b)` | `exec_ref_sound` |

The overflow obligation is GENUINE: `evalArith op a b` is `none` when the math result leaves
`[0, ty.bound)`. The negative lemma `nat_coercion_underflow_breaks_soundness` proves a nat-coercing
`a - b` (clamping the underflow to `0`) DISAGREES with `execDenote = none` at `a=0,b=1:u64` — pinning
that the Rust encoder must stay bounded (its `binop_str` emits `-`, never a `wrapping_sub`/`as nat`).

### 2B. Bounded cast targets — `cast_target` ↔ `encCast`/`castVal` (no nat/int)

| Target | Rust arm (`exec_encode.rs::cast_target`) | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| u32 | `Type::Prim(PrimType::U32) => Ok("u32")` | `encCast \| IntTy.u32 => …`; `castVal u32 v = v.value % 2^32` | `as u32` wraps at width 32 | `tokCast_encCast`; `exec_ref_sound` |
| u64 | `Type::Prim(PrimType::U64) => Ok("u64")` | `IntTy.u64`; `castVal u64 = % 2^64` | wrap at 64 | `tokCast_encCast` |
| usize | `Type::Prim(PrimType::Usize) => Ok("usize")` | `IntTy.usize` (width 64); `% 2^64` | wrap at usize=64 | `tokCast_encCast` |
| u8 | `Type::Named(n) if matches!(n, "u8"\|"u16") => Ok(n.clone())` (u8) | `IntTy.u8`; `castVal u8 = % 2^8` | narrowing wrap at 8 | `tokCast_encCast` |
| u16 | same arm (u16) | `IntTy.u16`; `% 2^16` | wrap at 16 | `tokCast_encCast` |
| bool / nat / int | `PrimType::Bool => Err(…)`; `other => Err(Unsupported("… NEVER nat/int"))` | (absent — `IntTy` has NO nat/int) | OUT; the exec encoder NEVER nat-coerces | neg: `nat_coercion_underflow_breaks_soundness` (the whole point) |

The #122 inner-paren (`encode_cast`: emits `{e} as {target}`, relying on `encode_binary`/`encode_unary`
having already wrapped a Binary/Unary inner — pinned by the in-Rust `e1_cast_inner_paren` test
`(n - 1) as u8`) and the #146 outer-paren (`is_lt_leading`: `matches!(op, Lt|Le|Shl)`,
`encode_binary_operand` wraps a `Cast` left operand — in-Rust `e2_cast_lt_outer_paren`
`((x as u32) < 33)`) match Table 1B's discipline on the bounded side.

### 2C. Index + overflow framing — `encode_index` ↔ `ExecExpr.index` / `evalArith`

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `xs[i]` (slice) | `encode_index` `IndexArg::Single(i)` over slice-bound base: `Ok(format!("{}[{idx}]", segments[0]))`; `idx = encode_index_value(i)` (`<p> as int`) | `execDenote .index slice idx => … if 0 ≤ iv.value ∧ iv.value < xs.length then some (.int (xs.get …)) else none` | `xs[i as int]` is the bounded i-th element; out-of-range → obligation `none` | `exec_ref_sound`; `slice_index_value_is_twenty` |
| range index | `encode_index` non-`Single` → `Err(Unsupported("slice-range … not a scalar"))` | (absent — `ExecExpr.index` is single only) | a sub-slice is not a scalar exec value | n/a (faithful) |
| non-slice base | `encode_index`: `Err(Unsupported("index over a non-slice base"))` | (absent) | OUT of frozen exec subset | n/a |

The overflow-obligation framing is the key 2A/2B match: Rust `exec_ref_value` emits bounded ops
whose Verus exec semantics carry the no-overflow VC; Lean `execDenote` returns `none` exactly there
(`evalArith` range check) — `add_overflow_has_no_value` + `encoder_agrees_on_overflow` pin both
sides agreeing.

---

## Table 3 — `thermite-tv/src/exec_stmt_encode.rs` ↔ `lean/Thermite/Exec/Stmt.lean`

`body_ref_state` threads a big-step environment (`Env = BTreeMap<String, Expr>`); Lean
`bodyRefState`/`refStmt` thread a `State` (an `ExecEnv` + an in-scope `scope` set). `body_ref_sound`
proves `bodyRefState = bodyDenote`. The per-RHS value at each position is delegated to
`execRefValue` (Table 2), exactly as Rust delegates to `exec_ref_value`.

### 3A. `thread_stmt` arms ↔ `refStmt` arms

| Construct | Rust arm (`thread_stmt`) | Lean arm (`refStmt`) | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `let n = rhs` | `Stmt::Let`: re-shadow guard `if env.contains_key(name) { Err }`; else `substitute(init,env); env.insert(name, …)` | `.letS name init => if st.scope name then none else do let v ← execRefValue init st.env; some ((st.setVar name v).bind name)` | a `let` binds the RHS substituted under the current env; re-shadow → `none` (encoder `Err`) | `body_ref_sound` (via `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote`) |
| re-shadow Err | `Err(Unsupported("re-shadowed binding …"))` | `if st.scope name then none` | flat env cannot hold two cells | `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote` (letS) |
| `n = rhs` (assign) | `Stmt::Assign`: target must be bare `Path[1]`; cell must be in env (`if !env.contains_key(&name) Err`); `substitute(value,env); env.insert` | `.assign name value => if st.scope name then do let v ← execRefValue value st.env; some (st.setVar name v) else none` | order-sensitive rebind of an in-scope cell; unbound → `none` | `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote` (assign); B2 `b2_mutation_order_matters` |
| non-scalar/non-bare target | `Stmt::Assign` non-`Path[1]` target → `Err(Unsupported("… indexed / field / projection … OUT"))` | (absent — `Stmt.assign` takes a `name : String`) | `xs[i]=e` is OUT (v2 sequence theory) | n/a (faithful absence) |
| unbound assign | `if !env.contains_key(&name) { Err }` | `else none` | malformed body | `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote` |
| expr-stmt | `Stmt::Expr(e)`: `let _ = substitute(e, env)?; Ok(())` (encode-and-discard) | `.exprS e => do let _ ← execRefValue e st.env; some st` | no state effect; surfaces a value error | `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote` (exprS) |
| `Stmt::If` | `Stmt::If { cond, then, else_ }`: `let mut then_env = env.clone(); thread_branch(then, &mut then_env)?; … else_env = env.clone(); …; let cell_names = env.keys().cloned().collect(); for name in cell_names { … compose Expr::If … }` | `.ifElse cond thenB elseB => do let c ← asBool (← execRefValue cond st.env); let branch ← (if c then refBlockThread thenB st else refBlockThread elseB st); some (st.restoreScope branch)` | branch on cond; recompose pre-`if` cells; discard branch-local `let` | `refStmt_eq_stmtDenote` (ifElse); see note below |
| `xs[i]=e` gate | (the non-bare-target `Err` above) | (absent) | `Unsupported` | n/a |
| early `return` (non-tail) | `Stmt::Return(_) => Err(Unsupported("early return in non-tail …"))` | (absent — no `Stmt.return`) | multi-exit CPS, OUT of v1 | n/a (faithful) |
| `Loop`/`Break`/`Continue` | each `=> Err(Unsupported("… step 2.2.2"))` | (absent — no loop `Stmt`) | loops kernel-gated (#163) | n/a (faithful) |

**The `Stmt::If` env.clone + env.keys() ↔ `restoreScope`.** Rust threads each branch into a CLONE
of the pre-`if` env (`let mut then_env = env.clone()`), then recomposes only the cells in
`env.keys()` (the pre-`if` cell set), so a branch-local `let` does not leak. Lean models this as
`State.restoreScope pre branch`:

```
def State.restoreScope (pre branch : State) : State :=
  { env := { vars := fun s => if pre.scope s then branch.env.vars s else pre.env.vars s
             slices := pre.env.slices }
    scope := pre.scope }
```

— an in-scope (pre-`if`) cell takes the branch's value, a non-pre-`if` name keeps the pre value, and
the post-`if` scope is the pre scope. This is precisely the Rust `env.keys()` recomposition. **This
arm was the #186 divergence**: an earlier Lean `ifElse` leaked branch-local scope; the ACToR loop
found it (`0256fd1c`), fixed it to match the `env.clone()` discipline (`6050b4cb`), and re-verified.
`StmtDivergence.lean` records the divergence as a kernel-checked artifact, not a `sorry`.

### 3B. The tail value + multi-cell projection ↔ `bodyRefState`/`bodyDenote`

| Construct | Rust arm | Lean arm | Bridge | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tail value | `encode_block_tail`: thread stmts, then `Some(tail) => encode_value(tail, env)` | `bodyRefState b st = do let stf ← refBlockThread b st; match b.blkTail with \| some t => execRefValue t stf.env \| none => none` | tail evaluated in the final env | `body_ref_sound` |
| no tail | `None => Err(Unsupported("… no tail value …"))` | `\| none => none` | body-refinement compares a result value | `body_ref_sound` |
| if-expr tail | `encode_value` `Expr::If` arm: composes branch tails into `if {c} { {t} } else { {e} }` (with int-unify) | `bodyDenote`/`execDenote` if-expr (via `execRefValue`) — Lean models the if at the value level | both compose the taken branch | `b3_if_branch_taken` |
| tuple tail (multi-cell) | `body_ref_state_ensures` `Expr::Tuple` arm: per-projection `result.{i} == {cell}` conjunction | (Lean `bodyDenote` returns the threaded tail value; the multi-cell projection is the obligation SHAPE in `body_ref_state_ensures`) | each cell compared at the bounded type | partially — see Discrepancy D5 |

The B1–B4 in-Rust tests (`b1_let_chain_state`, `b2_mutation_order_state`, `b3_if_branch_state`,
`b4_multi_cell_tuple_state`) and the Lean B1–B3 theorems (`b1_let_chain_threads`,
`b2_mutation_order_matters`, `b3_if_branch_taken`) cross-check the same threading on both sides.

## Table 4 — `forge/src/lean_export.rs` ↔ `lean/Thermite/Ast.lean` + `Denote.lean` (the EXPORTER, REQ-6 EXP)

The Thermite→Lean obligation EXPORTER (`forge/src/lean_export.rs`, the #240 chain, increment (ii-b))
emits Lean SOURCE that INSTANTIATES the spine `Expr`/`Registry`/`Env`/`stabilizes` encodings — it does
NOT define a new semantics. Its faithfulness (EXP, `.design/verified/proof-backends.md` REQ-6) is the
SAME inspection-tier discipline as Tables 1–3: each `encode_expr` arm maps a frozen-subset Thermite
`Expr` (the `thermite-syntax::ast::Expr` variant) to the `Ast.lean` constructor TERM whose denotation
`Denote.lean` assigns it. An OUT-of-spine construct is a structured `ExportRefusal` (an honest skip),
NOT a silent omission. Unlike Tables 1–3 (which target Verus TEXT), the exporter targets the SAME
inductive the spine is proven over, so the bridge is DIRECT (the emitted constructor IS the spine
datum) and the "Verus-meaning" column is replaced by the targeted spine arm.

### Table 4B — the EXEC-BODY bridge arms (`export_straight_line_body`, §4.1 / REQ-10, increment (iv-b))

The straight-line-body exporter serializes the body into the spine's `Exec/Stmt.lean`
`Block`/`Stmt`/`ExecExpr` encodings (the SAME arm-by-arm discipline; the targeted spine is
`lean/Thermite/Exec/Stmt.lean` + `Exec.lean`, kernel-checked, NOT Verus text). Each arm below is a
DIRECT inspection row.

| # | Thermite node (`thermite-syntax`) | `lean_export.rs` arm (`encode_exec_*`/`emit_state_of`) | Targeted spine constructor (`Exec.lean`/`Exec/Stmt.lean`/`Denote.lean`) | Inspection tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| exec cast | `Expr::Cast { ty ∈ u32/u64/usize }` | `Exec.ExecExpr.cast inner IntTy.{u32,u64,usize}` | `ExecExpr.cast`+`castVal` (bounded WRAP, never nat/int) | direct (OUT: a `nat`/`int` cast target — those are S_C, not S_E) |

| Stmt.exprS | `Stmt::Expr(e)` | `Exec.Stmt.exprS {e}` | `Stmt.exprS` (encode-and-discard) | direct |

**Re-pin coverage note (Amendment 2026-06-11, #255).** The `1438dc5f` spine additions that touch
the CONTRACT family — `Expr.boolVar` (`Ast.lean`), `Env.bools`/`Env.bindBool` (`Denote.lean`), and
`bodyConverges`/`bindResult` (`Exec/Stmt.lean`) — are audited HERE, in Table 4B's rows: the bool
param/`result` positions of the `stateOf` row, the `bindBool` bind + `bodyConverges` HYPOTHESIZE
antecedent of "the body theorems" row. They are pinned by the four `PinExec*` bridge pins and
`PinExportBoolResult` (`true_false_indistinguishable_in_intVal` — the genuine-bool-sort-not-Int-0/1
witness). They are NOT Tables-1/2/3 surface: no Rust reference encoder (`ref_encode`/`exec_encode`/
`exec_stmt_encode`) emits a `boolVar` — the only producer is the `lean_export.rs` exporter audited in
Tables 4/4B. The 2026-06-11 re-pin therefore adds NO correspondence surface outside the audited tables.

**OUT-of-fragment residuals (the honest skips — `ExportRefusal::OutOfFragment`/`NotPureContract`/`LoopBody`/`OptResResult`/`OpenHole`).**
`Expr::Field` (struct-field, Discrepancy D6), `Expr::TupleProj` (D6), `Expr::StructLit`, `Expr::Deref`,
`Expr::StrLit`, `Expr::Tuple`, `Expr::If` (no S_C if-Expr), a bare `Expr::Closure` (closures appear ONLY
as a combinator predicate), a qualified `Path`, a non-`u64/u32/usize/nat/int` cast target, a non-`len`/
`byte_at` method, a user-ADT / guarded match arm, an integer (bitwise) `!`, a `loop`/`while`/`break`/
`continue`/mid-body-`return`/non-scalar-mutation body (`LoopBody`, §4.1.7 — the loop residual is the
future increment), an Option/Result-typed straight-line-body result (`OptResResult`, #254 — no `ExecVal`
optres variant), a boundary fn, and an open hole (`?N`, L0). Each is a structured refusal the
`LeanEngine` maps to `Unknown` (a skip), NEVER `Proven`/`Refuted` — the same out-of-`S_C`/`S_B` honesty
as Tables 1–3's catch-all `Err` arm. (A non-pure-tail body is NO LONGER a residual — it routes to the
Table 4B exec-body exporter; only loops/optres/the genuinely-OUT exec constructs refuse.)

**The exporter's OWN regression oracles (the Rust mirror of the kernel-checked pins).** The four
critic pins (`PinIntBottom`/`PinStabilization`/`PinBodyRegistry`/`PinDecMeasure`/`PinRegistryTerminating`)
gate the SPINE; the exporter's mirror is the LIVE `forge/src/engine.rs` test suite — a CORRECT contract
kernel-accepts (`live_scalar_correct_contract_is_proven`), a WRONG one fails the tactic (`live_wrong_
contract_is_unknown_never_refuted`, Unknown NEVER Refuted), an OMITTED-registry obligation REFUSES the
export (`omitted_registry_obligation_refuses_export`, the Pin B/C/E/F mirror — the bottom-poisoned
discharge is UNREACHABLE because the export refuses BEFORE emission), and a recursive registry is
tier-(c) interactive (`recursive_registry_is_interactive_unknown`). The live `lake env lean` kernel
check of the emitted shape is `forge/tests/lean_engine.rs::live_spine_elaborates_emitted_shape_correct_
proves_wrong_fails`.

**The exec-body bridge regression oracles (Table 4B; increment (iv-b), #253).** The four spine pins
(`PinExecValueBridge`/`PinExecBoolBind`/`PinExecOverflowVacuity`/`PinExecStateMisMap`) gate the SPINE;

## The bridge assumptions (the inspection's own trust items)

This audit's correctness rests on three named assumptions — they are the residual trust the
inspection tier carries (the extraction tier would discharge A2/A3 mechanically; A1 is irreducible
on any tier that targets Verus text).

- **A1 (Verus expression semantics).** The emitted strings MEAN what we say under Verus's documented
  expression semantics — operator precedence, and the parenthesization discipline making the strings
  PARSE to the intended ASTs. The #122 inner-paren and #146 outer-paren are the load-bearing cases:
  the negative lemma `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness` proves the inner-paren is denotation-critical,
  and the #146 `is_lt_leading` outer-paren is a PARSE-SAFETY guarantee (without it `x as u32 < 33`
  mis-parses as a generic-arg list — a hard parse error in Verus and Rust, surfaced as
  "Unverifiable," not a wrong meaning). A1 is the irreducible Verus-target trust (the
  `thermite-semantics.md` reduced-trusted-base table item #1, the target semantics).
- **A2 (fuel ↔ Verus well-founded unfolding).** The Lean fuel index on `refDenote`/`refIntVal`
  /`denote` models Verus's well-founded `spec fn` unfolding (every Thermite spec fn carries a
  mandatory `measures` measure, §4.2 ⟹ termination ⟹ a well-founded fixpoint). The Rust `encode_call`
  case (3) does not inline (it emits a call), so the fuel models the MEANING of the recursive spec-fn
  definition, not a Rust recursion bound. The soundness is proved for ALL fuel and both sides share
  the fuel + registry, so it is fuel-uniform (the `Denote.lean`/`RefEncode.lean` headers state this;
  not a fuel-cap dodge).
- **A3 (symbolic closed-form env ↔ big-step transformer).** The Rust `exec_stmt_encode.rs` threads a
  symbolic `Env = BTreeMap<String, Expr>` of closed-form value EXPRESSIONS, and its module doc
  asserts this represents the big-step state transformer. The Lean `Stmt.lean` models the same
  threading as a `State` transformer over `ExecVal`s (`refStmt`/`refBlockThread`). The inspection
  trusts that the Rust symbolic substitution (`substitute`) and the Lean concrete threading denote
  the same transformer — `body_ref_sound` + the B1–B4 cross-checks are the evidence; the equivalence
  of "substitute-closed-forms-then-encode" vs "thread-concrete-values" is the assumption.

## What this inspection does NOT cover (honest residuals)

- **String-level formatting / whitespace.** The audit maps the emitted AST shape and tokens, NOT
  byte-exact strings. The Rust `encode_match` brace/indent layout, the if-tail
  `strip_one_enclosing_paren` cosmetic strip, and the int-unify `as int` coercion in
  `encode_value`'s if-arm are formatting choices Verus parses identically; they are not modelled in
  Lean (which works at the AST level). A formatting bug that still parses to the same AST would not be
  caught by Lean — but would be caught by the per-run Z3 TV (which sees the real string) and by the
  golden lowering files.
- **The production lowerer (`thermite-lower`).** NOT in scope. The whole architecture exists because
  the production lowerer is NOT verified — it is checked PER RUN by Z3 TV against the reference
  encoder. This doc audits the REFERENCE encoder ↔ its Lean model; the production lowerer ↔ reference
  link is the Z3 `h_tv` premise (`Faithfulness.lean`), not this inspection.
- **Loops (`while`/`loop`/`break`/`continue`, #163) — now covered ELSEWHERE, cross-referenced here,
  NOT absorbed into this doc's arm tables.** This doc's Tables 1–3 audit the STRAIGHT-LINE `S_B`
  fragment and remain loop-free; the v1 `while`-loop correspondence is a SEPARATE audit artifact and
  stays under its own authority. As of the #163 loop-TV arc, the Rust loop arm `loop_ref_obligations`
  (`thermite-tv/src/exec_stmt_encode.rs` @ `6f5b8b53`) produces the three per-run reference pieces, and
  the Lean side proves the partial-correctness `while_rule` + its TV meta-theorem `tv_meta_loop`
  (`lean/Thermite/Exec/Loop.lean` @ `6f5b8b53`; its code is unchanged across the later comment pass). The correspondence between the three Rust obligations
  and the Lean `while_rule`/`tv_meta_loop` premises was fidelity-audited in the #163 ACToR arc (the
  loop-TV critic verified the Lean premises match the Rust obligations) and lives under the authority of
  **`.design/verified/loop-tv.md`** — named here as a cross-reference, deliberately NOT silently
  absorbed into Tables 1–3. The straight-line encoders still honestly `Err` on a loop OUTSIDE the v1
  frozen `while` subset; that residual is unchanged.
- **The Map accessor + Option/Result frame (#150).** `encode_map_accessor`
  (`contains_key`→`spec_contains_key`, `len`→`len`) and the `RefCtx` Map/Option frame are in the Rust
  encoder but NOT in the Lean `S_C` fragment (which covers Option/Result via `match`/`is` but not Map
  membership) — see Discrepancy D3.
- **Struct-field / tuple-projection access in contract position.** The `ref_encode.rs::encode`
  `Expr::Field` arm (`result.x` → `{r}.{name}`) and `Expr::TupleProj` arm (`result.0` → `{r}.{index}`)
  are live in the Rust encoder but have NO Lean `Expr` constructor — the Lean `S_C` fragment does not
  model member access. Reachable in a struct-field / tuple-projection `ensures`; inspection-only (no T1
  theorem) — see Discrepancy D6.
- **The extraction-bridge tier (REQ-2, the named stronger closure).** A Lean→Rust extraction (or a
  Rust-side proof) would make the Rust encoder equal the Lean model BY CONSTRUCTION, discharging A2/A3
  and the inspection entirely. There is no Lean→Rust extraction tooling for this encoder shape today
  (the encoders are hand-written Rust producing Verus strings, not extracted from Lean). The
  audit-by-inspection tier is the accepted interim per `thermite-semantics.md` REQ-6 / the
  reduced-trusted-base table item #3.
- **Drift.** This doc pins the audited commits (above). Any edit to a pinned encoder file invalidates
  the corresponding table section and requires re-audit. **Recommended future work: a CI guard** that
  fails when `thermite-tv/src/{ref_encode,exec_encode,exec_stmt_encode}.rs` or
  `thermite-spec/src/combinators.rs` change without a matching update to the pinned SHAs here (a
  blocker-tracked enhancement, not a v0.1 kernel item).

## Discrepancies found

Every arm was checked. The correspondence is CLEAN at the denotation level for every arm in the
frozen subset. The items below are NOT meaning mismatches — they are places where the Lean model
ABSTRACTS a Rust string detail (sound), or where the Rust encoder covers MORE than the Lean fragment
(a residual, not a bug). They are recorded for honesty so a re-auditor knows exactly where the two
sides are not arm-for-arm identical.

- **D1 (the `Eq` nat-coercion string is abstracted, not modelled — SOUND).** Rust `encode_binary`
  emits `result as nat == spec_sum(xs)` (the `as nat` on the bounded operand, Eq-only,
  `is_nat_valued`-gated). Lean does NOT emit an `as nat` token in the `cmp` arm; it routes both
  operands through `refIntVal`/`castDenote` over the shared `Int` domain, where `castDenote nat` under
  the `≥0` source frame is the identity. The Lean model is therefore a SOUND ABSTRACTION of the Rust
  coercion (the meaning is the same int comparison), but it does NOT pin the Eq-ONLY gating or the
  `is_nat_valued` detection — those are pinned only by the Rust unit/teeth tests + the per-run Z3 TV,
  not by a Lean theorem. A re-auditor should treat the Eq-only coercion gating as inspection-only.
- **D2 (#146 outer-paren is a parse-safety property, not a Lean denotation theorem).** The Rust
  `is_lt_leading` outer-paren is pinned in Lean only indirectly (the cast value is the same; the paren
  prevents a mis-parse). There is no Lean lemma "dropping the #146 outer-paren breaks soundness"
  analogous to the #122 `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness`, because dropping it yields an UNPARSEABLE
  string (Unverifiable), not a wrong meaning. This is faithful (the in-Rust `e2_cast_lt_outer_paren`
  test pins it), but it lives under Bridge Assumption A1, not a Lean theorem.
- **D3 (Map membership is a Rust-encoder residual, not in Lean `S_C`).** `encode_map_accessor`
  (`contains_key`→`spec_contains_key`, `len`→`len`) was added by #150; the Lean `S_C` fragment models
  Option/Result (`match`/`is`) but NOT Map membership. So the Rust Map arm has NO Lean counterpart.
  This is a residual (the Lean fragment is a subset of what the Rust encoder admits), not a mismatch —
  the Map arm's correspondence is currently inspection-only (its faithfulness rests on the in-Rust
  `forge/tests/contract_tv_conformance.rs` `map_kv` corpus entry + per-run Z3, not a Lean theorem).
  A future Lean increment could embed Map membership.
- **D4 (guard arms / non-2-arm matches are Rust-encoder territory not modelled in Lean).** Rust
  `encode_match` emits a guard arm (`{pat} if {g} => {body}`); the Lean `MatchArm` has no guard, and
  `denoteArms` models exhaustive 2-arm `Some/None`/`Ok/Err` selection. The corpus matches are
  exhaustive 2-arm, so the modelled fragment matches the EXERCISED encoder behavior; the guard-arm
  path of `encode_match` is inspection-only (no corpus clause uses it, no Lean theorem pins it).
- **D5 (multi-cell tuple projection: the obligation SHAPE is Rust-only).** `body_ref_state_ensures`
  builds the per-projection `result.{i} == {cell}` conjunction for a tuple tail. Lean `bodyDenote`
  returns the threaded tail VALUE (including a tuple), proved sound by `body_ref_sound`; the
  per-projection obligation SHAPE (`result.0 == … && result.1 == …`) is the Rust obligation
  construction, cross-checked by the in-Rust `b4_multi_cell_tuple_state` test, not by a distinct Lean
  theorem. The state denotation (the cells' closed forms) IS pinned; the obligation packaging is
  inspection-only.
- **D6 (struct-field / tuple-projection ACCESS in contract position is a Rust-encoder residual, not
  in Lean `S_C`).** The `ref_encode.rs::encode` dispatch has two live arms that emit a Verus
  projection-access string and have NO corresponding Lean `Expr` constructor:

  ```rust
  Expr::Field { receiver, name } => {
      let r = encode(receiver, ctx)?;
      Ok(format!("{r}.{name}"))          // struct-field access  result.x
  }
  Expr::TupleProj { receiver, index } => {
      let r = encode(receiver, ctx)?;
      Ok(format!("{r}.{index}"))         // tuple projection     result.0
  }
  ```

  They emit the Verus member-access token `<receiver>.<name>` / `<receiver>.<index>` (the receiver
  recursively re-encoded). They are reachable in the frozen contract subset for a struct-field `ensures`
  (`result.x == 0`) and a tuple-projection `ensures` (`result.0 == a`) — the multi-cell/struct CONTRACT
  surface. (This is DISTINCT from D5: D5 covers the EXEC-BODY tuple obligation SHAPE built by
  `body_ref_state_ensures`, i.e. the `result.{i} == {cell}` conjunction the body-refinement emits;
  D6 covers these `ref_encode.rs::encode` CONTRACT-position projection arms.) The Lean `Expr`
  inductive (constructors `intLit/boolLit/var/cmp/logic/neg/arith/cast/seqVar/strVar/idx/subrange/`
  `seqLen/byteAt/comb/optResVar/match_/is_/specCall`, `lean/Thermite/Ast.lean`) has NO `field` or
  `tupleProj` constructor, so the Lean `S_C` fragment does not model struct-field / tuple-projection
  access at all. These two arms therefore have NO Lean counterpart and NO (T1) theorem backing —
  exactly like the Map accessor (D3) and the guard-arm path (D4): a Rust-encoder arm covering MORE
  than the Lean fragment, not a meaning mismatch.

  **Consequence.** A contract that uses `result.x` (struct field) or `result.0` (tuple projection)
  relies on the per-run Z3 translation validation alone for that arm, WITHOUT the Lean T1
  (`ref_sound`) backing the rest of the contract subset enjoys: the per-run `h_tv` attestation still
  checks the production lowering against this reference arm, but CORR for this arm rests on the
  inspection of the two quoted lines above (the emitted `{r}.{name}` / `{r}.{index}` IS the Verus
  member-access denotation), not on a kernel-checked Lean theorem.

  **Future brick.** Extending Lean `S_C` with a `field`/`tupleProj` constructor (a value projection
  over a struct/tuple `ExecVal`/`RefVal`, denoting member access) is a candidate next increment —
  the SAME shape as the proven rewrites (a structural arm with a `ref_sound` case + a negative lemma
  pinning the projection choice), which would promote D6 from inspection-only to T1-backed.

None of D1–D6 is a denotation mismatch. The arm-by-arm correspondence holds at the meaning level for
every construct in the frozen subset; D3/D4/D6 are Rust-encoder arms that lie OUTSIDE the Lean
fragment (inspection-only, no Lean counterpart), enumerated so a re-auditor knows exactly where the
two sides are not arm-for-arm identical.

## Verification

This doc is the audit artifact; its "verification" is the groundedness of every row (AC-2) and the
existence of the cited Lean theorems. The Lean spine builds clean and `sorry`-free at `69236a22`.
The existing audited v1 files are code-identical across the later comment pass; the Stage 2/3
modules are additive (see Amendment 2026-07-29):

- `lake build` (Lean `v4.29.0` since the #184 probe; the audited spine builds core-only-equivalent) — the spine compiles; `#print axioms lowering_faithful`
  shows `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (standard).
- The cited (T1) theorems: `Thermite.ref_sound` / `ref_sound_eq` (Soundness.lean),
  `Thermite.Exec.exec_ref_sound` (Exec.lean), `Thermite.Exec.body_ref_sound` (Exec/Stmt.lean),
  composed in `Thermite.lowering_faithful` (Faithfulness.lean).
- The negative lemmas cited per row are theorems in Soundness.lean / Exec.lean (e.g.
  `eq_le_infidelity_breaks_soundness`, `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness`,
  `byteview_misdispatch_breaks_soundness`, `index_argkind_slice_view_breaks_soundness`,
  `match_arm_swap_breaks_soundness`, `is_wrong_variant_breaks_soundness`,
  `specfn_arg_order_breaks_soundness`, `count_where_wrong_pred_breaks_soundness`,
  `permutation_set_model_breaks_soundness`, `nat_coercion_underflow_breaks_soundness`).
- The Rust encoders' own teeth/unit tests: `thermite-tv/tests/{teeth,exec_teeth,body_teeth}.rs`
  (F1–F4 / E1–E4 / B1–B4 against real `verus`) and the in-module `#[test]`s pin the Rust output the
  Lean models mirror.

## REQ status

| REQ | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-1 (the arm-by-arm correspondence map) | SHIPPED | This doc IS the deliverable. Every arm of `ref_contract_pred`/`exec_ref_value`/`body_ref_state` and the 8 combinator `verus_l3` forms is EITHER a row in Tables 1–3 OR an explicitly-listed out-of-Lean-scope residual (the `ref_encode.rs::encode` dispatch is enumerated exhaustively in Table 1H — its `Expr::Field`/`Expr::TupleProj` arms are residual D6, no Lean counterpart). Each row quotes the actual Rust arm (`thermite-tv/src/{ref_encode,exec_encode,exec_stmt_encode}.rs` @ `6f5b8b53`, plus `thermite-spec/src/combinators.rs` @ `543b506e`) beside the actual Lean arm (`lean/Thermite/{RefEncode,Denote,Exec}.lean` + `Exec/Stmt.lean`; the audited code is unchanged at spine pin `69236a22`, see Amendment 2026-07-29), the Verus-meaning bridge, and the pinning Lean theorem + negative lemma. Bridge assumptions A1–A3 enumerated; residuals + discrepancies D1–D6 recorded honestly. Closes the `thermite-semantics.md` REQ-6 correspondence residual at the audit-by-inspection tier. |
| REQ-2 (the extraction bridge — Lean→Rust extraction or a Rust-side proof) | NOT-STARTED | open prereq blocker #185 (this doc's blocker tracks both tiers; the inspection tier is REQ-1 SHIPPED, the extraction tier stays open). Gap: there is no Lean→Rust extraction tooling for this encoder shape — the encoders are hand-written Rust producing Verus STRINGS, not Lean-extracted code, so the inspection (this doc) is the accepted interim per `thermite-semantics.md` REQ-6 / the reduced-trusted-base table item #3. The named stronger closure (extraction or a Rust-side proof making the Rust encoder equal the Lean model by construction) is future work; until then A2/A3 stay inspection-trusted and a CI drift-guard (recommended above) is the cheap interim hardening. |
