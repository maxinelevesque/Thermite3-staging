# Doc-Drift Tripwire — content freshness for every routed design doc

<!--
tier: 3-component
status: draft
governs: gates/doc-drift.py + the `audited-content-sha256:` / `audited-sha:`
         header fields this doc mandates for every routed .design doc + the
         `make doc-drift` Makefile target (and the SEQUENCED CI step — see
         REQ-10). Explicitly NOT `gates/audit.sh`, which this component
         leaves byte-identical (decision 5).

Mechanism-only and opt-in per doc via pin-extract: <file>=code-normalized; no existing pin's value or rule changed, and the oracle suite is gates/tests/test_doc_drift_extract_code.py (C-1..C-6: the measured 2026-08-07 fmt event must be silent, a rename through a format string must still fire). prior: 7d39fe2b32b725bace3654f9e7129fadc67cc2ff409d2ceb78c79302a8735beb, previously (re-pinned 2026-08-10 for the .design/tooling -> .design/gates move. I predicted this would need NO re-pins, on the correct premise that a pin digests the GOVERNED SOURCE and the source does not move. The premise held; the prediction did not, because the governed Python sources cite their own design doc path in their module docstrings - doc-drift.py says 'the detailed rules are in .design/gates/...' - so rewriting the reference changed the source and moved the digest. Second-order, same family as the glob-membership case recorded on stage4: the thing that moved was not the governed file, but something the governed file mentions. No rule and no behaviour changed; reqs check reports 536 requirements and 124 views, unchanged. Note also that req-registry's governed set includes registry.toml, whose 6 REQ-REG entries moved scope 'tooling' -> 'registry' in the same commit. prior: 96da3811ab63a96761f075e958a9e247f622bd99a80f35eb8474cb9f185afdc8.))

-->

## Summary

`.design/` docs are the per-component contracts (`goal.md` authority chain), and the
spec-discipline hook guarantees they EXIST and are READ before a routed edit — but
nothing checks their CONTENT is still true of the code. They drift silently:
`.design/forge/cli.md`'s Summary still says "This component is GREENFIELD … Every REQ
below is NOT-STARTED, blocked on issue #5" while `forge/src/cli.rs` is 2,778 lines with
a dozen verbs, and 21 commits have touched `cli.rs` since the doc's last-touch commit
`1004b7a1`. This component converts that staleness from a silent failure into a loud,
gated one — the same move `#[slag]` (§8) makes for unverified code: every routed design
doc pins an `audited-content-sha256:` digest over the contents of its governed file
set (with legacy `audited-sha:` commit pins still accepted as a fallback). The gate
(`gates/doc-drift.py`, run by CI and by `make doc-drift`) FAILS whenever the
governed file contents differ from the pinned digest. The gate is deliberately NOT
part of `make audit`: doc freshness is a development-discipline invariant, not a
link in the proof-trust chain (decision 5). Clearing the gate is a conscious act:
re-pin content after confirming the doc remains accurate, or amend the doc and pin
the amended claim.

## The drift this closes (grounded motivating example)

```
$ git log -1 --format=%h -- .design/forge/cli.md      # the doc's last claim
1004b7a1                                              # 2026-06-04, "#5"
$ git log --format=%H 1004b7a1..HEAD -- forge/src/cli.rs | wc -l
21                                                    # twenty-one unreviewed-by-the-doc commits
```

The doc is internally split (its `## REQ status` table was updated to SHIPPED at #5,
but its Summary prose still claims greenfield) AND externally stale (goal-repl #193,
kernel-target #197, proof-backends #247, currency-pass #257 all reshaped `cli.rs`
after the doc's last touch). Today nothing fires. After this component,
`make doc-drift` fires, naming the doc, the file, and those 21 commits.

## Design decisions (resolved here, grounded below)

1. **Pin granularity: ONE content digest per doc** (`audited-content-sha256:` in
   the doc's HTML-comment header), not per-route. The doc is the claim-bearing unit; the route table is
   many-to-many (107 routes, 48 distinct docs today — e.g.
   `.design/basis/09-option-result.md` governs 13 files, and `forge/src/check.rs`
   carries 6 governing docs), and the gate inverts routes to `doc → {files}` and
   checks every governed file against the doc's single digest. Per-route pins would
   put 13 pins in one header and make "which pin?" ambiguous for shared docs. The
   legacy `audited-sha:` commit pin remains accepted only as a migration fallback.
2. **Drift predicate: content hash first, full-history commit-set fallback.** Doc D
   with governed file set F(D) has drifted iff the deterministic aggregate SHA-256
   over F(D)'s current contents differs from `audited-content-sha256:`. If a legacy
   commit pin P is the only pin present, D has drifted iff
   `git log --full-history --format=%H <P>..HEAD -- <f>` is non-empty for any
   `f ∈ F(D)`. Date comparison is wrong under rebases; `--full-history` prevents
   Git's path-limited history simplification from making merge-parent order change
   the fallback answer. Content hashes are preferred because the primary check is a
   data-consistency problem, not git archaeology.
3. **No grandfathering.** A routed doc with neither an `audited-content-sha256:`
   line nor an `audited-sha:` line FAILS the gate,
   naming the doc. No allowlist, no warning tier. The bootstrap (REQ-5) is the
   one-time pinning commit.
4. **Honest bootstrap: pin each doc at its OWN last-touch commit**
   (`git log -1 --format=%H -- <doc>`), NEVER blanket-pinned at HEAD. Blanket-HEAD
   would mechanically assert "all 48 docs are accurate now," which is known false —
   MEASURED false: at doc-last-touch pins, **35 of 48 routed docs are drifted**
   (derived with raw git against commit `6368550a`, pre-bootstrap — see the REQ-10
   backlog table for the heaviest entries). A blanket-HEAD bootstrap would
   rubber-stamp all 35, violating R-HONEST-3. Doc-last-touch pins each doc at the
   moment it last made its claims; the gate's first run then reports the TRUE drift
   backlog, each entry filed as a blocker and worked off by re-audit + re-pin or
   amendment. (Doc-last-touch is a proxy — see OQ-6. The 35/48 count is a
   snapshot and will shift slightly by the time the pin sweep lands: commits keep
   touching routed files — e.g. #257's `6368550a` itself touched
   `thermite-skill/src/generate.rs` and `forge/src/cli.rs` after the measurement.)
5. **Enforcement surface: `make doc-drift` + a SEQUENCED CI step — NOT
   `make audit`, NOT a per-edit hook.** Three exclusions, three reasons:
   - **Not `gates/audit.sh`.** `make audit` re-derives the PROOF-TRUST chain:
     its six checks (README: "The six checks, precisely") are all links in the
     soundness story, and check [4] qualifies because the Rust↔Lean correspondence
     is a NAMED RESIDUAL-TRUST item in check [6]'s list. General design-doc
     freshness is a DEVELOPMENT-DISCIPLINE invariant: a stale
     `.design/forge/cli.md` does not weaken any shipped proof. Wiring this gate
     into the audit verdict would (a) muddy the trust statement the README sells —
     "the six checks, precisely" would no longer be precisely the soundness story —
     and (b) turn the audit INCONCLUSIVE/FAILED for non-soundness reasons,
     especially acute given the 35/48 bootstrap backlog (decision 4): a skeptic
     running `make audit` on day one would see FAILED over doc hygiene.
     `gates/audit.sh` is byte-identical under this component (AC-7).
   - **Not a per-edit hook.** A PostToolUse gate would fire constantly mid-build:
     every builder commit touching a routed file drifts its doc until the closing
     re-pin, so freshness is a commit-time/CI-time invariant, not an edit-time one.
     Named as OQ-4.
   - **CI is sequenced, not day-one.** See REQ-10: the CI step lands only once the
     bootstrap backlog is cleared; until then the gate is runnable-but-advisory via
     `make doc-drift` — an honest, named, temporary state, not a silent one.

## Requirements

Substrate this component builds on (already shipped):

- REQ-1 (route table as the enumeration source): the set of checked docs is exactly
  the deduplicated `design` fields of `gates/routes.toml` `[[route]]` entries;
  the file set per doc is the union of that doc's routes' `crate_pattern`s. The route
  table is already "the single source of truth" and "the authoritative module map"
  (`goal.md` scope section). Source: `goal.md` authority chain; spec-routes.toml
  schema header.
- REQ-2 (parsing substrate): the gate reuses the spec-discipline parsing approach —
  stdlib `tomllib` (Python ≥3.11; this machine runs 3.13.13), and, should a route
  ever carry a glob `crate_pattern`, the `glob_to_regex`/`match_pattern` treatment —
  no third-party deps, consistent with the other two gates in `tooling/`. (Finding:
  ZERO of the 107 current routes use a glob; all `crate_pattern`s are literal paths.
  Glob handling is required only for forward-compat — see REQ-6.)
- REQ-3 (exit-3 honest-inconclusive PRECEDENT): `gates/audit.sh`'s
  `pass`/`fail`/`skip` + `SKIPPED_GUARANTEES` discipline — "a skipped check is NOT
  a pass," `DEEP AUDIT INCONCLUSIVE` exits 3, distinct from FAILED's 1 — is the
  shape REQ-9's exit-code contract MIRRORS. That is this substrate's ONLY role
  here: a precedent the tool's own 0/1/3 contract copies. The tool's wiring does
  NOT call into `audit.sh` and `audit.sh` does not call the tool (decision 5);
  this REQ survives the REQ-10 redesign purely as the exit-code-3 precedent.
- REQ-4 (the precedent): check [4] (`gates/audit.sh`, "CORRESPONDENCE DRIFT
  TRIPWIRE") already implements the bespoke single-doc version: extract pinned SHAs
  from `rust-lean-correspondence.md`'s table, compare each against
  `git log -1 --format=%h -- <file>`, FAIL on mismatch. It stays bespoke in v1
  (OQ-1); this component generalizes the IDEA, not that code path — and check [4]
  stays in the audit (where this gate does not go) because its subject is a named
  residual-trust item (decision 5).

New work:

- REQ-5 (the pin fields + bootstrap): every doc referenced by a
  `[[route]].design` field carries, in its existing HTML-comment header block
  (the `tier:`/`status:`/`governs:` block every doc already has), one preferred
  content pin line:

  ```
  audited-content-sha256: <64-hex aggregate SHA-256>
  ```

  The aggregate digest is computed deterministically over the doc's sorted
  governed `crate_pattern` set. For each pattern, the digest records the pattern,
  then either a stable missing marker or each matched repo-relative file path plus
  that file's SHA-256 content digest. Legacy docs may also carry:

  ```
  audited-sha: <40-hex full commit SHA>[ <optional free-text annotation>]
  ```

  meaning: "this doc's claims were verified accurate against the tree as of this
  commit." Full 40-hex (not the 8-hex short form check [4]'s table uses) so a
  legacy commit pin can never go ambiguous as the repo grows. The tool prefers the
  content pin whenever present.
- REQ-6 (the gate, `gates/doc-drift.py`): a stdlib-only python3 tool that
  (a) loads `gates/routes.toml` via `tomllib`, (b) inverts routes to
  `doc → sorted({crate_pattern})`, (c) extracts each doc's pin per REQ-5,
  (d) for a content pin, recomputes the governed-file aggregate SHA-256 and
  compares it directly, and (e) for a legacy commit pin, validates the pin
  (`git rev-parse --verify <P>^{commit}` + `git merge-base --is-ancestor <P>
  HEAD`) and applies the fallback drift predicate per governed file with
  `git log --full-history` — for a literal path, pathspec `<f>`; for a glob
  pattern, pathspec `:(glob)<f>`. A routed file that does not exist is represented
  explicitly in the content digest; under the legacy fallback, a routed file with
  no commits in `<P>..HEAD` is CURRENT.
- REQ-7 (loud, named failure): each content drift is reported as the doc path, the
  pinned content digest, the current content digest, and the governed file
  patterns. Each legacy commit drift is reported as the doc path, its pinned SHA,
  the governed file, and the intervening commits (`git log --full-history
  --oneline <P>..HEAD -- <f>`). Output ordering is deterministic: sorted by doc
  path, then file path / pattern (R-CODE-5).
- REQ-8 (missing/invalid pin = FAIL): a routed doc with neither pin line, a
  malformed `audited-content-sha256:` digest, or a legacy commit pin that fails
  REQ-6 validation is a FAIL naming the doc and the defect class (`MISSING-PIN` /
  `INVALID-PIN`), distinct from `DRIFT`. No grandfathering (decision 3).
- REQ-9 (exit-code contract): `0` = every routed doc pinned and current; `1` = at
  least one DRIFT / MISSING-PIN / INVALID-PIN; `3` = the gate could not determine
  the answer (no git repo / git absent / `tomllib` absent / `spec-routes.toml`
  unreadable) — mirroring the audit's INCONCLUSIVE=3 precedent (REQ-3: "a skipped
  check is NOT a pass"). The tool never exits 0 without having checked all 48 docs.
- REQ-10 (Makefile + CI wiring, SEQUENCED — replaces the rejected audit.sh
  wiring): `Makefile` exposes two local entry points. `make doc-drift-worktree`
  invokes `python3 gates/doc-drift.py` directly against the current worktree,
  preserving the tool's precise 0/1/3 exit-code contract for scripts that need to
  branch on drift vs environment failure. `make doc-drift` mirrors pull-request
  CI: it synthesizes a base-first merge commit from `DOC_DRIFT_CI_BASE`
  (default `origin/main`) and `DOC_DRIFT_CI_HEAD` (default `HEAD`) with
  `git merge-tree --write-tree`, checks that commit out in a temporary worktree,
  and runs the same Python gate there. GNU make still collapses any nonzero
  recipe exit to its own exit 2; the precise class is carried by the tool's
  printed report. `gates/audit.sh` is NOT touched — the gate is
  development-discipline, not proof-trust (decision 5; AC-7 pins this as
  byte-identical). `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same gate on GitHub's PR
  merge ref / pushed commit checkout.

  **The enforcement-activation sequencing, explicitly:**
  1. tool (`gates/doc-drift.py`) + bootstrap pins (REQ-5, doc-last-touch) land;
  2. the first gate run's backlog (~35 docs at measurement; the exact sweep-time
     count will differ slightly — see decision 4) is tracked as blocker issue(s);
  3. the backlog is worked off doc-by-doc: re-audit the intervening diffs, then
     re-pin or amend (the re-pin workflow below);
  4. the CI step lands IN THE COMMIT THAT CLEARS THE LAST BACKLOG ITEM, so CI's
     first doc-drift run is green by construction and every subsequent red is a
     genuinely new drift.

  Until step 4, the gate is RUNNABLE-BUT-ADVISORY (`make doc-drift`) — an honest,
  named, temporary state, not a silent one: the backlog blockers are the loud
  record that enforcement is pending. The heaviest measured backlog entries, for
  scale (raw git at `6368550a`, doc-last-touch pins): `.design/basis/09-option-result.md`
  (13 governed files drifted, e.g. `thermite-lower/src/lower.rs` +25 commits),
  `.design/lower/boundary-composition.md` (`lower.rs` +46),
  `.design/scaffold/workspace.md` (`forge/src/main.rs` +23),
  `.design/forge/cli.md` (`cli.rs` +20 at measurement, +21 at `6368550a` — the
  motivating witness).
- REQ-11 (self-governing route): `gates/routes.toml` gains

  ```toml
  [[route]]
  crate_pattern = "gates/doc-drift.py"
  design = ".design/gates/doc-drift-tripwire.md"
  reference = []
  conformance_ops = []
  ```

  so the gate is itself routed to this doc, and this doc's pin must be bumped in
  any commit that edits the gate (the gate fires on itself otherwise — the dogfood
  property). HONEST LIMITATION, verified against the hook source: NO `tooling/*.py`
  file is routed today, and even with this route the spec-discipline hook would not
  enforce it — `is_gated_path` in `gates/spec-discipline.py` requires
  `TARGET_EXTENSION = ".rs"`, a crate dir matching `thermite-`/`forge`, and a `src/`
  component, all of which `gates/doc-drift.py` fails. The route entry in v1 is
  therefore DECLARATIVE (it makes the gate's own doc-drift checkable by doc-drift.py
  itself, which IS enforced); extending `is_gated_path` to gate `tooling/*.py`
  edits is OQ-5, not assumed here.

## Acceptance criteria

- AC-1: with a routed file's content changed after its doc's content pin, `python3
  gates/doc-drift.py` exits 1 and its output names the doc path, the pinned
  digest, the current digest, and the governed pattern. The legacy fallback also
  reports intervening commit SHAs with `--full-history`.
- AC-2: with every routed doc content-pinned to the current governed file
  contents, the tool exits 0 and prints one CURRENT summary line per doc.
- AC-3: deleting both the `audited-content-sha256:` and `audited-sha:` lines from
  any one routed doc flips the exit to 1 with a `MISSING-PIN` line naming that doc.
- AC-4: a content pin that is not a 64-hex SHA-256 digest, a legacy commit pin that
  is not a 40-hex resolvable commit, or a legacy commit pin that is not an ancestor
  of HEAD flips the exit to 1 with an `INVALID-PIN` line naming the doc —
  textually distinct from a `DRIFT` line.
- AC-5: run outside a git repo (or with `git` shadowed off `PATH`), the tool exits
  3, never 0 and never an unhandled traceback.
- AC-6: a route whose `crate_pattern` has never been committed (e.g.
  `forge/src/session.rs`) produces no drift for its doc (REQ-6 unbuilt-file rule).
- AC-7: `make doc-drift-worktree` exits 0 when the direct tool exits 0 and
  nonzero otherwise (GNU make collapses failing recipes to exit 2 — REQ-10
  caveat; the 0/1/3 contract is the DIRECT invocation
  `python3 gates/doc-drift.py`) and prints the tool's report. `make doc-drift`
  evaluates a CI-style base-first merge ref in a temporary worktree. In both
  cases `gates/audit.sh` is UNCHANGED by this component (byte-identical — the
  gate is outside the proof-trust chain, decision 5).
- AC-8: two consecutive runs on an unchanged tree produce byte-identical output
  (deterministic ordering, R-CODE-5).

## Architecture

`gates/doc-drift.py` is the third gate in `tooling/`, shaped like its siblings
(`spec-discipline.py`, `anti-pattern-gate.py`): stdlib-only python3, a
PROJECT-CUSTOMIZATION constants block, top-of-file docstring stating the rule it
enforces and citing this doc. Unlike the siblings it is NOT a Claude-Code hook in
v1 (decision 5): it is invoked by CI, by `make doc-drift`'s temporary merge-ref
worktree, or directly via `make doc-drift-worktree` / `python3
gates/doc-drift.py`.

Pipeline (one pass, no state file):

1. **Enumerate** — `tomllib.load(open("gates/routes.toml","rb"))["route"]`,
   exactly the `load_routes` approach in `spec-discipline.py` (which guards
   `try: import tomllib / except ImportError: tomllib = None` for pre-3.11; the
   gate instead treats absent `tomllib` as exit-3 environment failure, because a
   CI gate that fails open is a silent pass — R-HONEST-3). Invert to
   `doc → sorted(set(crate_patterns))`.
2. **Extract** — prefer first
   `^audited-content-sha256:\s*([0-9a-f]{64})\b` match per doc; otherwise fall
   back to first `^audited-sha:\s*([0-9a-f]{40})\b` match (REQ-5). Both fields
   live in the same HTML-comment header every doc already carries (`tier:` /
   `status:` / `governs:` / `thesis-refs:` — see any routed doc).
3. **Validate + compare** — per doc: content pins compare the deterministic
   governed-file digest directly. Legacy commit pins validate the commit
   (REQ-6(d)), then apply the fallback commit-set predicate
   `git log --full-history --format=%H <P>..HEAD -- <pathspec>`. Subprocess exit
   statuses are always inspected; a git invocation failing for environmental
   reasons is exit 3, never treated as "no drift" (the R-CODE-4 discipline
   applied to git instead of a solver).
4. **Report + exit** — REQ-7 lines, REQ-9 codes.

**The trust boundary (why this gate lives OUTSIDE `gates/audit.sh`):**
`make audit` re-derives the proof-trust chain — its six checks (README: "The six
checks, precisely") are each links in the soundness story, ending in check [6]'s
honest residual-trust statement. Check [4] earns its slot because the Rust↔Lean
correspondence it drift-checks is one of [6]'s NAMED residual-trust items: if that
doc is stale, the inspection-tier residual is stale and the audit verdict honestly
degrades. No `.design/` contract has that property — a stale `.design/forge/cli.md`
weakens no shipped proof. Putting this gate in the audit would dilute the verdict's
meaning and, given the measured 35/48 bootstrap backlog, make the audit FAIL for
reasons a skeptic does not care about. So: check [4] stays in the audit, this gate
stays out, and the two mechanisms share only the IDEA of pinned-SHA drift-checking.

The relationship to check [4] (`gates/audit.sh`), mechanically: check [4] reads a
PER-FILE pin table inside one unrouted doc (`rust-lean-correspondence.md`, whose
"Audited commits" table pins five artifacts in backticked 8-hex, extracted by the
`pin_sha_for` awk helper) and compares each against
`git log -1 --format=%h -- <file>`. That doc is not a `[[route]].design` target
(verified against the route table — no route names it), so the general gate does
not see it and the two mechanisms do not overlap in v1. The general gate also
deliberately uses the commit-SET predicate rather than check [4]'s
last-touch-equality compare: equality of `git log -1` output is correct for
check [4]'s purpose but conflates "drifted" with "pin newer than last touch"
(which the re-pin workflow legitimately produces when a doc is re-audited without
the code changing). Unification is OQ-1.

**The re-pin workflow** (how the gate is cleared, per the §8 loudness model):

- *Code changed, doc still accurate*: review the governed diff, confirm doc claims
  hold, and refresh `audited-content-sha256:` to the current governed contents.
  For a legacy commit-pin-only doc, review
  `git log --full-history --oneline <P>..HEAD -- <f>` (the gate prints it), then
  either add a content pin or bump `audited-sha:` to the new last-touch / HEAD in
  a commit whose message states the verification.
- *Code changed, doc now wrong*: dispatch acto-doc-author to amend the doc
  (R-DOC-1: the doc adapts to the code), pinning the amendment commit's tree state.
- The gate cannot distinguish the two (both are "pin bumped in a commit") — OQ-2.

## Verification

- **Fixture tests** (`gates/tests/test_doc_drift.py` or a shell harness — note:
  `tooling/` has NO existing test convention; the two shipped gates are untested,
  so this gate introduces the first one): build a throwaway git repo in `tmpdir`
  with a mini route table + two docs + governed files, then assert AC-1 (commit
  after pin → exit 1 naming both), AC-2 (exit 0), AC-3 (`MISSING-PIN`), AC-4
  (`INVALID-PIN` on a bogus 40-hex, on a non-ancestor, and on a malformed content
  digest), AC-6 (route to an uncommitted path), AC-8 (byte-identical reruns), the
  content-pin drift path, and the merge-parent-order regression where simplified
  path history hides a main-side edit but `--full-history` reports it for legacy
  commit pins. Expected values are hand-built fixture facts, never the tool's own
  output (R-CHAR-3).
- **Live-tree smoke**: `python3 gates/doc-drift.py` on the real repo exits 0
  when every routed doc's `audited-content-sha256:` matches its governed files.
- **Makefile wiring**: `make doc-drift-worktree` is exit 0 iff the tool exits 0,
  and nonzero (make's collapsed 2) for both the 1- and 3-cases, with the class
  visible in the printed report. `make doc-drift` additionally synthesizes the
  CI-style base-first merge worktree before invoking the same tool.
- **Audit untouched**: `git diff <pre-component-commit> -- gates/audit.sh` is
  empty in the component's commits (AC-7's second half); `bash gates/audit.sh`
  output names the same six checks before and after.

## Route-table addition needed (NOT made by this doc — R-DOC-1, builder's commit)

The REQ-11 `[[route]]` block above, appended to `gates/routes.toml` in the
same commit that creates `gates/doc-drift.py`. Finding for the orchestrator: no
`tooling/*` path is routed today, and the spec-discipline hook structurally cannot
gate `.py` files (REQ-11 evidence), so this route is enforceable only by
doc-drift.py itself until OQ-5 is resolved.

(Separately: `.design/00-index.md` nominally indexes the docs, but it has not been
updated since commit `1e008994` — it still lists every doc as "planned" and knows
nothing of `.design/basis/`, `.design/verified/`, `.design/build/`, or this
`.design/gates/` area. Index maintenance is NOT a live convention; this doc adds
no index entry and flags the index itself as a doc-drift instance the route table
cannot catch, since the index is unrouted. Named in OQ-7.)

| REQ-1 (route table as enumeration source) | SHIPPED | `gates/routes.toml` header: "spec-routes.toml — the Thermite route table (single source of truth)… Each route maps a toolchain source file to the design doc that governs it". Non-test consumer: `def load_routes in gates/spec-discipline.py` → `def find_routes`, wired as the PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` (`python3 "$HOOK"` on `gates/spec-discipline.py`). Verification: `python3 -c "import tomllib; …"` → 107 routes, 48 distinct `design` docs, all 48 exist on disk, 0 glob patterns. |
| REQ-2 (tomllib/glob parsing substrate) | SHIPPED | `try: import tomllib  # Python 3.11+` + `def load_routes` + `def glob_to_regex` + `def match_pattern in gates/spec-discipline.py`. Non-test consumer: the spec-discipline hook itself (`.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse on Write\|Edit). Verification: `python3 --version` → `Python 3.13.13` (tomllib available); the hook blocks routed edits live in this harness. |
| REQ-3 (exit-3 honest-inconclusive precedent) | SHIPPED | `gates/audit.sh`: `pass()`/`fail()`/`skip()` helpers; `SKIPPED_GUARANTEES=()`; verdict block "INCONCLUSIVE is NOT a pass… Exit NONZERO (3, distinct from FAILED's 1) so automation cannot read a skipped-guarantee run as green (R-HONEST-3)". Non-test consumer: `make audit` (`Makefile`: `audit: @bash gates/audit.sh`). Role here is PRECEDENT-ONLY: REQ-9 mirrors the 0/1/3 shape; nothing in this component calls into or out of `audit.sh` (decision 5). |
| REQ-4 (check [4] precedent, stays bespoke AND stays in the audit) | SHIPPED | `gates/audit.sh` "[4/5] CORRESPONDENCE DRIFT TRIPWIRE": `pin_sha_for()` extracts backticked hex from `.design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md`'s "Audited commits (PINNED…)" table; compare `cur="$(git log -1 --format=%h -- "$pf")"`; on mismatch `fail "$pf — DRIFTED: pinned $pinned, current $cur"` + `RC=1`. Non-test consumer: `make audit`. Verification: the doc's two amendment blocks record the tripwire firing and being cleared by verified re-pins (#200, #255). Its subject is a check-[6] residual-trust item — the property this gate's subjects lack (decision 5). |
| REQ-5 (`audited-content-sha256:` preferred pin + legacy `audited-sha:`) | SHIPPED | Routed docs carry content pins in their HTML-comment headers, with legacy `audited-sha:` retained for provenance / fallback. The tool prefers the content pin when present. |
| REQ-6 (the gate `gates/doc-drift.py`) | SHIPPED | `gates/doc-drift.py` loads `gates/routes.toml`, inverts `doc → patterns`, computes content digests, and falls back to full-history commit-set checks for legacy SHA-only docs. |
| REQ-7 (loud doc+file/pattern failure report) | SHIPPED | Content drift reports doc path, pinned digest, current digest, and governed patterns; legacy commit drift reports doc path, governed file, and intervening full-history commits. |
| REQ-8 (missing/invalid pin = FAIL, no grandfathering) | SHIPPED | `MISSING-PIN` fires when neither content nor commit pin exists; `INVALID-PIN` fires for malformed content digests and invalid legacy commit pins. |
| REQ-9 (exit-code contract 0/1/3) | SHIPPED | Direct tool exits 0 for current, 1 for DRIFT/MISSING-PIN/INVALID-PIN, and 3 for environment failures. |
| REQ-10 (Makefile + CI wiring) | SHIPPED | `Makefile` has `doc-drift-worktree` for direct worktree checks and `doc-drift` for a CI-style base-first temporary merge worktree; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `python3 gates/doc-drift.py` with full checkout history. |
| REQ-11 (self-governing route entry) | SHIPPED | `gates/routes.toml` routes `gates/doc-drift.py` to this doc, so the gate's own implementation is covered by the doc-drift check. The edit hook still does not gate `.py` files; that limitation remains outside this component. |

## Open questions

- **OQ-1 (check [4] unification):** keep check [4] bespoke in v1 (RECOMMENDED,
  assumed above — and reinforced by decision 5: check [4] is audit-side, this gate
  is not, so unifying the code would blur the trust boundary). Its pin table is
  per-FILE inside an UNROUTED doc, its compare is last-touch equality, and its
  semantics ("the arm-by-arm inspection predates this encoder") are finer-grained
  than per-doc freshness. A v2 could let doc-drift.py read an in-doc per-file pin
  table as an override of the header pin and retire the awk extractor; not
  designed here.
- **OQ-2 (re-pin vs amendment provenance):** the gate sees only "pin bumped in a
  commit"; it cannot distinguish a verified re-pin from a rubber-stamp, nor a
  content amendment from a pin-only bump. Out of scope v1 — the commit-message
  ceremony (the rust-lean-correspondence amendment precedent) carries the claim,
  and the acto-critic adversarially audits rubber-stamps. A v2 could require the
  re-pin commit to also touch the doc body, or to cite the reviewed range.
- **OQ-3 (QUOTED-SYMBOL lint):** extracting backticked symbol anchors from docs
  (`pub fn lower_fn in lower.rs`) and grepping them against the tree would catch
  CONTENT drift, not just commit drift. DEFERRED — named, not in v1; it needs an
  anchor grammar and a false-positive budget the SHA tripwire doesn't.
- **OQ-4 (per-edit hook):** running the gate as a PostToolUse/PreToolUse hook would
  fire on every mid-flight builder edit (any routed-file edit drifts its doc until
  the closing re-pin), making the loop unworkable. v1 is `make doc-drift` + the
  sequenced CI step only; a commit-time (pre-commit) variant is the plausible
  middle ground if silent drift re-accumulates between runs.
- **OQ-5 (gating `tooling/*.py` edits):** extending `is_gated_path` in
  `spec-discipline.py` (`.py` extension + `tooling/` dir) would make REQ-11's route
  hook-enforced, and would for the first time route the gates themselves. Touches
  the hook's PROJECT CUSTOMIZATION constants; orchestrator's call, not assumed
  here.
- **OQ-6 (bootstrap pin proxy):** doc-last-touch is a proxy for "when the doc's
  claims were last verified" — too generous when a doc's last touch was a trivial
  cite fix, too strict never. The alternative (manually re-auditing all 48 docs at
  bootstrap) is the honest maximum but is itself the backlog the gate exists to
  schedule (measured: 35/48 drifted — decision 4). v1 accepts the proxy and lets
  the per-doc re-pin work restore full honesty incrementally.
- **OQ-7 (unrouted docs) — PARTIALLY RESOLVED (#263):** the gate covers exactly
  the routed docs. Unrouted `.design/` files — `.design/research/**`,
  `rust-lean-correspondence.md` (check [4]'s domain) — are invisible to it.
  `00-index.md` (stale since `1e008994`, called every doc "planned") was DELETED
  as dead convention at #263: the route table is the live module map, and a
  manually-maintained index is exactly the silent-drift artifact this gate
  exists to eliminate. The research/correspondence residue stays named.
