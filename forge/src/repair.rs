//! `forge/src/repair.rs` — the background L1/L2 → L3 proof-repair loop (issue #18,
//! `.design/forge/proof-repair.md`; `thermite-design.md` §6, Appendix B). Once a
//! `forge check` run has left an item below L3 because verus could not prove it
//! within its resource budget (a timeout: inconclusiveness, the #10 ladder /
//! #11 classification), repair tries to drive that item back up to L3 by the one
//! mechanical, checkable move §6 sanctions: budget escalation. It re-verifies the
//! item along a fixed, bounded geometric `--rlimit` ladder (reusing the same
//! `check.rs` verus driver); the first budget at which the item proves is an
//! upgrade to L3 (the winning budget is recorded). An item that never proves even
//! at the cap stays sub-L3 and repair surfaces the #11 repair prompt (the
//! `SolverProfile` + `suggested_move` + the failing obligation) for the agent's
//! own move (a custom proof hint).
//!
//! The anti-cheat invariant (R-DEFER-9, §12). Repair escalates a timeout and
//! nothing else. A counterexample (verus disproved the contract:
//! `postcondition not satisfied`, no profile report), a vacuity
//! reject (`rejected_vacuity`), a weak-contract reject (`rejected_weak_contract`),
//! and any non-timeout sub-L3 status are hard fails: repair reports them and never
//! retries them at a higher budget, never upgrades them to L3. More budget does not
//! make a false thing true. The gate is [`classify_sub_l3`] returning
//! [`SubL3Status::Timeout`] (the sole trigger for [`escalate`]); every other
//! verdict short-circuits to [`SubL3Status::NotRepairable`] and the escalation
//! closure is never invoked. This is the dual of the #10 down-ladder's
//! anti-cheat (`degrade.rs`): inconclusiveness moves, falsity does not.
//!
//! This module composes the shipped pieces; it owns no new prover-invocation
//! logic. It re-drives `check::check_file_with_rlimit` (the `--rlimit` seam, #11)
//! at each escalated rung, maps the resulting `Certificate` into a
//! [`RepairVerdict`], and reads the #11 `SolverProfile`/`suggested_move` off a
//! still-failing cert for the prompt.
