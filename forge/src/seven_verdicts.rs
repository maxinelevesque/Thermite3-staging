//! `forge/src/seven_verdicts.rs` — the seven-verdict hermetic suite (`.design/
//! stage1-forge-tier.md` REQ-10 / AC-14: "a hermetic test per verdict (seven tests named
//! for their verdict)"). One `#[test]` per cert-level verdict
//! ([`crate::verdict::CertVerdict`]), each named for its verdict and each exercising the
//! verdict at the boundary that PRODUCES it, so the gate's "seven hermetic tests" claim is
//! literally met. The suite runs under `cargo test -p forge` — the F4 lean job runs it with
//! the built spine, and the z3-gated producers run there (z3 ships with verus).
//!
//! Why the production boundary (not always the full binary): the relax route's
//! `Proved`/`Counterexample`/`RealWitness` are produced by [`crate::engine::NlsatEngine`]
//! (z3-gated — they run in CI where z3 is present); `CovenantRefuted` is produced by the
//! verus-free covenant engine (ungated); `Stuck`/`KernelBudget`/`Timeout` are produced
//! upstream by [`crate::verdict::cert_verdict_for_lean`] from the lean transcript (a live
//! kernel-budget exhaustion is inherently non-deterministic, so the hermetic exercise is
//! the deterministic transcript→verdict→cert production the live path funnels through —
//! `KernelBudget` additionally drives the cert builder [`crate::check::
//! lean_unverifiable_cert`]). Together: every one of the seven verdicts has a named,
//! hermetic, CI-run test. The closure-instrumented never-degrades tests
//! (`crate::degrade`) are unchanged.
