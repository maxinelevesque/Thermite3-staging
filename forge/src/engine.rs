//! `forge/src/engine.rs` — the backend-neutral proof-engine interface and the Verus
//! engine refactored behind it (`.design/verified/proof-backends.md` REQ-2/REQ-3/
//! REQ-3.1/REQ-8; increment (i), blocker #204).
//!
//! Today one engine is welded into `check::check_file_with_options` (the implicit
//! `run_verus` + `classify_verus_outcome` path). This module introduces the
//! [`Engine`] trait — the four slots REQ-2 names (fragment, discharge, trust
//! profile, evidence) — and refactors the Verus discharge byte-identically behind
//! it, with the one named exception of the REQ-3.1 fast-unknown remap.
//!
//! The REQ-3.1 fast-unknown seam is the single behavioral delta. The shipped
//! `classify_verus_outcome` absorbs the SMT incompleteness-`unknown` into its
//! `Counterexample` bucket (an `unknown` returned fast, no `--profile` report → the
//! failure path). A byte-identical Verus engine would map that `Counterexample` to
//! [`Verdict::Refuted`] → `ladder_action_l3` hard fail, contradicting REQ-3 ("an
//! SMT `unknown` is `Unknown`, never `Refuted`; refutation requires a witnessing
//! input"). So [`VerusEngine::verdict_of`] splits the `Counterexample` by
//! [`counterexample_is_incompleteness_unknown`], the narrow SMT-`unknown`
//! signature: a span-less failure carrying the SMT-`unknown` signal (no parsed
//! `--> file:line:col` span and no frontend `error[E…]` type error) maps to
//! [`Verdict::Unknown`] (degrade, matching §6's degrade-on-incompleteness intent); a
//! witnessed countermodel (a parsed span) and a frontend rejection (a type error
//! `error[E…]`) both stay [`Verdict::Refuted`] (hard fail, never degrades).
//!
//! The narrow signature preserves cert-oracle byte-identity. The remap is the sole
//! exception to increment (i)'s byte-identical claim, and it is inert on the
//! conformance corpus. The corpus contains `Counterexample`-bucket failures, notably
//! the provenance `careless_query` IFC path, which verus rejects with a span-less
//! type error `error[E0308]` the corpus pins at L0. A coarse "no parsed span →
//! Unknown" rule would degrade that E0308 to L2 (and crash on the ADT L2 lowering),
//! perturbing the oracle. The narrow signature keeps E0308 (and every witnessed
//! countermodel) at `Refuted` → L0, so it fires only on a SMT-`unknown`, a
//! case the corpus does not contain, leaving every `conformance/*.cert.json`
//! byte-identical (REQ-3.1's "the remap only changes behavior on inputs the corpus
//! does not contain").
