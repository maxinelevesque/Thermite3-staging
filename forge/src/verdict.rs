//! `forge/src/verdict.rs` — the seven-variant certificate-level verdict (REQ-1 /
//! AC-1; `.design/stage1-forge-tier.md`). The forge tier's closed outcome
//! vocabulary, a **separate cert-level enum**, not arms of [`crate::engine::Verdict`]
//! (the three-arm engine type `Proven`/`Refuted`/`Unknown`).
//!
//! ## The split (the §gap-analysis "verdict architecture" decision)
//!
//! The engine layer decides three things and only three: it `Proven`, it `Refuted`
//! (with a witness), or it could not decide (`Unknown`). Three of the seven cert
//! verdicts come from that, by a total map with no wildcard arm ([`CertVerdict::
//! from_engine_verdict`]): `Proven → Proved`, `Refuted → Counterexample`, `Unknown →
//! Timeout`. No `Unknown` survives into a certificate (R-VERDICT-1): the map is total,
//! so every engine verdict becomes one of the seven.
//!
//! The other four have **no engine-level source** — they are produced upstream at the
//! forge orchestration layer, each by a different increment's machinery:
//! - `RealWitness` — the relax route (REQ-8/2f): a real countermodel of a clause true
//!   over ℤ but false over ℝ, carrying the raw real point (the 3-arm engine `Verdict`
//!   cannot carry it). Escalates UP to the forge, never down to `Counterexample`.
//! - `CovenantRefuted` — the covenant check (REQ-4/2b): a `falsify` hit, a hard fail
//!   in the [`crate::degrade`] ladder with the same never-degrades treatment as
//!   `Counterexample`.
//! - `Stuck` — the frozen battery (REQ-5/2c): the proof did not close; carries the
//!   residual goal(s) + a missing-bridge hint.
//! - `KernelBudget` — the budget wrapper (REQ-1b): a Lean elaboration/kernel-budget
//!   exhaustion (Q4 30s/clause), detected upstream via the textually-distinct signal
//!   [`crate::tv_signal::is_kernel_budget_signal`] (Q-KBSIGNAL — a distinct Lean signal
//!   does exist: `(deterministic) timeout … maximum number of heartbeats` /
//!   `maximum recursion depth has been reached`, never confusable with the Z3 rlimit
//!   text), so a budget exhaustion is `KernelBudget`, never mis-mapped to `Timeout`.
//!
//! For the foundation (this increment) the variants, their construction sites, and the
//! serde are defined; the *producing logic* for `RealWitness`/`CovenantRefuted`/`Stuck`
//! is built by 2b/2c/2f, so those are constructed only in tests here (and at the
//! pinned construction sites the later increments fill).
