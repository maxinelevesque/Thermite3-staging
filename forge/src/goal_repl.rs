//! `forge/src/goal_repl.rs` — the Lean-style goal-state REPL surface
//! (`thermite-design.md` §5/§5.1, Appendix B). v1 ships all three increments:
//! `forge goal <file> [item]` and `forge battery <file> [item]` (pure views over
//! the shipped `check::check_file` cert collection), `forge edit <file> <addr>
//! --replace <code>` (a semantic-address source-text splice over the
//! `thermite_syntax::address` machinery, then a re-check), and increment (iii),
//! #193, `forge fill <file> <hole-addr> <code>`: the `?N` body-hole fill loop.
//! A `?N` hole lexes/parses in `thermite_syntax` (fn-body statement position only)
//! and is recorded on `FnItem.holes`; a holed item does not certify (`check`
//! short-circuits it to an `OpenHole` L0 cert before lowering, REQ-5); `forge
//! goal` renders the open holes as the §5.1 `holes:` section; `forge fill` splices
//! `code` at the hole's span (reusing the (ii) splice machinery) and re-checks,
//! surfacing any new holes the fill introduced (the §5.1 loop).
//!
//! These verbs add no verification: `goal`/`battery` are renders over the existing
//! per-item `Vec<Certificate>` (`goal` reads `cert.obligations` + the re-parsed AST
//! contract for given/want; `battery` reads `cert.contract_quality`, which already
//! carries the §7 vacuity + mutation verdicts the gate computed: a view, no
//! accessor needed, AC-1). `edit` resolves the address, splices the replacement at
//! the addressed node's byte span in the file, re-emits, and re-runs `check_file`.
//!
