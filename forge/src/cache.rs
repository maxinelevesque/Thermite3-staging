//! `forge/src/cache.rs` — the per-item, content-addressed proof cache and the
//! home of the bit-reproducible-verification contract (`thermite-design.md`
//! §5.3: "Proof results are content-addressed and cached per item").
//!
//! For each `.th` item, `check::check_file` computes a stable cache key from the
//! five inputs that determine one of that item's oracle fields (the item's
//! lowered Verus source, the pinned solver seed, the verus version, the thermite
//! toolchain version, and the item's declared effect row — the row determines
//! `Certificate::effects` without reaching the lowered source, REQ-1e),
//! consults the cache before spawning verus, returns the stored
//! [`Certificate`] on a hit (skipping the solver), and stores the result on a
//! miss. The cache is a performance optimization that does not change a verdict: a
//! hit is indistinguishable from a fresh verify (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9: the cache
//! does not affect a verdict).
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/proof-cache.md`.
//!
//! This module is a thin, deterministic, content-addressed store with no
//! verification logic of its own. It sits between `check::item_subprogram` /
//! `thermite_lower::lower` (which produce the lowered source it content-addresses)
//! and `check::run_verus` (the solver invocation it lets `forge` skip on a hit).
//! IO failures degrade to a miss, not a panic (R-CODE-2): a damaged cache is
//! slower, never wrong.

/// The version of forge's verdict-affecting check logic — the set of gates a
/// cached certificate was produced under (`.design/forge/proof-cache.md` REQ-2,
/// the soundness-completeness invariant). It is a further cache-key input
/// (domain-tagged + length-prefixed like the caller-passed ones) so that a certificate

/// existed (under an identical (lowered_src, seed, verus_version,
/// thermite_version) key, because `forge`'s crate version did not move) was served
/// on a hit and skipped the now-required gate.
///
/// Maintenance contract (blocker #49): bump this constant whenever the set of
/// verdict-affecting checks/gates changes (a gate added, removed, or its
/// pass/fail semantics altered, e.g. the §7 mutation floor, the vacuity battery,
/// the triage rejects). The `thermite_version` input does not suffice: the
/// toolchain ships gate changes without a crate-version bump (issue #12's
/// mutation gate landed at 0.1.0), so the check-logic version must move
/// independently. Without a bump the stale-verdict bypass re-opens.
///
/// History:
///   1 — pre-mutation-gate check logic (the original four-input key era).
///   2 — issue #12 §7 mutation floor added (blocker #49: invalidates every
///       pre-gate cert so a weak contract is re-checked through the gate).
///   3 — blocker #74: the §7 early-return mutant is now synthesized for a
///       `Vec<T>` return (an empty-Vec `TVec<Suffix> { data: Vec::new() }`,
///       mirroring the #48 `&[]` slice synthesis), so a `Vec`-returning fn is
///       scored instead of 0/0-gated to `WeakContract`. This changes the gate
///       verdict for `Vec`-return fns (a proved `push_one` now certifies L3
///       instead of the mutation-gated L0), so every cert stored under schema 2
///       must be re-checked under schema 3 (the maintenance contract above: a
///       gate-semantics change ⇒ bump, or a stale L0 is served on an identical
///       lowered-source key, REQ-2).
///   4 — blocker #80: the §7 early-return mutant is now synthesized for a
///       `String` return (an empty `TString { data: Vec::new() }`, mirroring the
///       #74 empty-`Vec` synthesis) in `mutation::early_return_value`'s
///       `Type::String` arm, so a `String`-returning fn is scored instead of
///       0/0-gated to `WeakContract`. This changes the gate verdict for
///       `String`-return fns (the proved `join`/`concat` now certifies L3 instead
///       of the mutation-gated L0), so every cert stored under schema 3 must be
///       re-checked under schema 4 (the maintenance contract above: else `forge
///       check` serves the stale L0 cached on an identical lowered-source key,
///       REQ-2: a hit must equal a fresh verify).
///   5 — blocker #101 (`.design/forge/equivalent-mutants.md` REQ-5): the §7
///       mutation gate now excludes a survivor Verus proves observably equivalent
///       to the body under `req` from the kill-ratio denominator
///       (`check::mutation_score` → `equivalence_proves_equal`). This changes the
///       gate verdict for forced-output fns (a `1/3` `WeakContract` `clamp_zero`
///       becomes a certifying `1/1` once its two proved-equivalent survivors
///       drop), so the check logic is no longer the same function of its inputs:
///       every cert stored under schema 4 must be re-checked under schema 5
///       (else `forge check` serves the stale `WeakContract` cached on an
///       identical lowered-source key, REQ-2: a hit must equal a fresh verify).
///   6 — blocker #269 (`.design/forge/mutation-scoring.md` REQ-9/REQ-10/REQ-12):
///       the §7 early-return family now also synthesizes the F-IDENT identity
///       returns (`return <param>` for every param whose type equals the return)
///       and the F-STRUCT-zero named-struct field-zero literal. Both are
///       verdict-changing widenings of the frozen mutant set (an item's `K/N`
///       and even its certify/gate verdict can change, e.g. `move_up` gains a
///       surviving `return b` identity mutant), so the check logic is no longer
///       the same function of its inputs: every cert stored under schema 5 must
///       be re-checked under schema 6 (else `forge check` serves a stale
///       pre-#269 tally / verdict on an identical lowered-source key, REQ-2: a
///       hit must equal a fresh verify).
///   7 — blocker #269 (`.design/forge/equivalent-mutants.md` REQ-7/REQ-9): the
///       per-survivor equivalence probe now handles call-bearing bodies. A §9
///       composition caller's F-IDENT identity survivor (`return <param>`) that
///       is proved equivalent through its callees' contracts (the exec-harness
///       arm) drops from the denominator. This is verdict-changing for
///       call-bearing fns: `caller(x) { ext_id(x) }`'s identity mutant flips from
///       a counted survivor (gating `WeakContract` at schema 6, the schema-6
///       Arc-1 build cached this) to an excluded equivalent (certifying L3). The
///       check logic is no longer the same function of its inputs, so every cert
///       stored under schema 6 must be re-checked under schema 7 (else
///       `forge check` serves a stale schema-6 `WeakContract` on an identical
///       lowered-source key, REQ-2: a hit must equal a fresh verify).
///   8 — RFC-3 homogeneous general-Verus migration: every current general-Verus
///       result must be assembled from a pre-execution `L3Artifact`, retaining
///       its query identity and classification on proof or non-claim. A schema-7
///       cached certificate predates that authority and cannot be upgraded after
///       deserialization, so it must miss and be produced again under schema 8.
///   9 — RFC-3 cache-domain repair: main-item, mutation, equivalence, and
///       strengthening queries now have distinct key roles, and partial EPR
///       evidence no longer enters an item-level certificate without a defined
///       aggregation. Schema-8 entries predate both verdict-affecting rules.
///  10 — typed result-arbiter migration: Verus, Lean fallback, EPR, vacuity, and
///       mutation outcomes now combine through one total precedence rule. Complete
///       supplemental proof cannot erase a counterexample or settled policy reject,
///       and replacement preserves orthogonal boundary/policy context. Schema-9
///       entries predate these verdict- and boundary-affecting semantics.
///  11 — cache-envelope integrity: the stored query key and canonical certificate
///       digest are verified before any certificate is decoded as authority. A
///       damaged policy verdict therefore misses instead of being promoted by a
///       coherent-looking public-field edit.
