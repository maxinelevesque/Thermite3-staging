//! `forge/src/manifest.rs` — the certificate schema (`thermite-design.md` §5.1,
//! Appendix A). The `Certificate` is the deliverable's trust statement (§6): a
//! stable, versioned data contract that `forge check` emits. This module owns the
//! schema and its `serde_json` (de)serialization; it performs no I/O and runs no
//! verification. `check.rs` (`.design/forge/check.md`) produces the values.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/certificate-manifest.md`.
//!
//! The schema is fixed now at its full Appendix A shape; the producers arrive
//! over several issues (the "two-speed schema"). #5 fills `item`, `level`,
//! `effects`, `slag`, and `obligations` with real derived values; the
//! `contract_quality.*` battery fields are forward-declared (#5 values not
//! asserted against the golden cert, made live by #6/#12/#13) and
//! `suggested_move` is a reserved `None`. `solver_time_ms` is present but
//! non-deterministic and excluded from the cert-oracle comparison.
