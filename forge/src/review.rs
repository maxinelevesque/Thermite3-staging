//! `forge/src/review.rs` — the pluggable spec-intent review slot (`forge review`,
//! `thermite-design.md` §7 line 227, §summary line 298, issue #19). The §7
//! "residue surfaced for review": the one irreducible judgment the deterministic
//! battery (#6/#12/#13 vacuity + mutation pre-screening) cannot make — "is this
//! contract what you meant?".
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/spec-review.md`.
//!
//! `forge review [item]` extracts the pre-screened declarative spec layer for each
//! `fn` — the verbatim `req`/`ens`/`fx` clauses plus the declaration (name, params,
//! return type, `dec` measure) of every directly-referenced `spec fn`, with no
//! bodies — and pairs each intent-reviewable contract with an "is this what you
//! meant?" prompt. It emits this as a machine artifact (`--json`, for a critic
//! model) and a human form, and defines the pluggable verdict slot
//! ([`ReviewVerdict`]) an external reviewer fills.
//!
//! Two data sources, both already shipped (mirroring `audit::AuditManifest`'s pure
//! projection):
//!
//! 1. The battery verdict — the `Vec<Certificate>` from [`crate::check::check_file`]
//!    (the same default-config pipeline `forge check`/`forge audit` run — no extra
//!    verification). The pre-screening predicate ([`is_intent_reviewable`]) reads
//!    `cert.reject`/`cert.level`: a cert is intent-reviewable iff it is reject-free
//!    and a certified rung (`manifest::cert_certifies` — L1/L2/L3, incl. a slag /
//!    boundary L1 whose contract is the trust statement, OQ-4). A battery-failing
//!    cert (`reject.is_some()`) is flagged [`battery_failing`] with its
//!    `reject.cause` and is not surfaced for intent review (R-DEFER-9: the
//!    mechanical failure is answered first).
//! 2. The contract surface — the parsed `Program` (`thermite_syntax::parse`). The
//!    spec layer is built from the verbatim `Clause.text` (`ast.rs`), and the
//!    spec-fn references are resolved by walking the contract clause `Expr`s for a
//!    callee name matching a top-level `Item::SpecFn`. Exclusion is structural: the
//!    projection reads `contract`/`name`/`params`/`ret`/`dec` and never touches
//!    `FnItem.body`/`SpecFnItem.body`, so "no bodies" is enforced by which fields
//!    are read (parallel to `audit::FunctionRow::from_certificate`).
//!
//! forge does not produce the `aligned` verdict (R-CODE-5): the extraction (the
//! artifact) is a deterministic pure projection; the verdict is the external
//! reviewer's. The `--reviewer <cmd>` shell-out pipes the JSON artifact to the
//! reviewer's stdin and reads the [`ReviewVerdict`] JSON from its stdout, attaching
//! it as a separate `*.review.json` record — not a `Certificate` field (OQ-2: the
//! cert is the mechanical verdict; intent review is a separate judgment). A
//! failing/absent reviewer cmd is a [`ForgeError`].
