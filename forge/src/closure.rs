//! `forge/src/closure.rs` — the §9 end-to-end vs to-the-boundary classification
//! (issue #17, `.design/forge/e2e-vs-boundary.md`; `thermite-design.md` §9).
//!
//! `thermite-design.md` §9 promises the manifest distinguishes "verified to the
//! boundary" from "verified, period". This module computes, for each `fn` in a
//! parsed file, its transitive intra-file call closure and classifies the
//! function's assurance scope:
//!
//! - End-to-end ("verified, period"): nothing in the closure is a
//!   `#[boundary]` (foreign, unproven body, #16) or `#[slag]` (trusted-by-fiat
//!   body, #6) fn. Every link is a proved / `spec fn` / combinator body, so the
//!   whole-program guarantee rests only on the toolchain.
//! - To-the-boundary ("verified to the boundary"): the closure transitively
//!   reaches a `#[boundary]` or `#[slag]` fn. The fn's own contract is verified,
//!   but the end-to-end guarantee crosses a foreign/unproven body at the crossing
//!   (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9: mark a guarantee that depends on an unproven
//!   foreign body; do not claim end-to-end when a boundary is reached).
//!
//! The analysis is pure and structural: it owns no prover invocation and changes
//! no verdict. It layers the §9 composition rule on top of the per-fn verdicts
//! `check::check_file` already produced; the result is recorded as the additive
//! `Certificate::assurance_scope` field ([`crate::manifest::AssuranceScope`]).
//!
//! ## What is pure, what is a crossing (`.design/forge/e2e-vs-boundary.md`)
//!
//! - Nodes are the file's `Item::Fn` and `Item::SpecFn`.
//! - Edges come from walking each `fn` body's `Expr::Call` / `Expr::MethodCall`
//!   (and every nested expression / statement) and resolving the callee by name.
//! - A callee resolving to an in-file `Item::SpecFn` is pure (a `spec fn` is total
//!   / terminating / body-Thermite-verified, §4.2; never a crossing, even when
//!   self-recursive like `spec_sum`).
//! - A callee resolving to a registry combinator (`forall_in`, `sorted`, … — the
//!   `thermite_spec` set, §4.2) is pure (a frozen-trigger proved library).
//! - A callee resolving to an in-file `Item::Fn` that is `#[boundary]` / `#[slag]`
//!   is a crossing; an in-file pure `Item::Fn` inherits its closure.
//! - A callee resolving to nothing in-file and not a combinator (a cross-file
//!   callee) is pure and ignored, not a crossing (OQ-1: cross-file resolution is a
//!   documented v0.1 limitation).
//!
//! The walk is cycle-safe (a visited set keyed by fn name; recursion does not
//! loop) and bounded (each node touched once), so it is O(nodes + edges) and
//! deterministic (R-CODE-5: a pure function of the parsed `Program`, no wall-clock
//! / unordered iteration in the verdict; the `via` crossing is the first reached
//! in source order, and the result is keyed in a `BTreeMap`).
