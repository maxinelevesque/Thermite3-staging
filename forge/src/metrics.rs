//! `forge/src/metrics.rs` — the §6 metrics dashboard (umbrella
//! `docs/v2/program.md` REQ-7 / AC-12: "From M1, `forge` emits the
//! routing-reason and verdict telemetry fields the §6 dashboard needs — cage-vs-forge
//! share by reason, verdict counts, TV phase split — and the audit prints them").
//!
//! This module is a **read-only projection** of telemetry `forge` already emits: the
//! per-clause `{engine, verdict}` attribution the schema-v2 certificate carries
//! (`manifest::ObligationResult`) and the translation-validation (TV) phase verdicts
//! (`contract_tv::TvCounts`). It aggregates three §6 metrics:
//!
//! 1. **cage-vs-forge share BY routing reason** — every discharged clause was routed
//!    either to the Verus/Z3 *cage* (the default push-button path) or escalated UP to
//!    the *forge* (the nlsat relax route or the Lean lemma route). The routing reason
//!    is a total, deterministic projection of the per-clause `engine` tag
//!    ([`RoutingReason::from_engine`]): `verus`/absent ⇒ in-cage, `nlsat` ⇒ relaxable,
//!    `lean-*` ⇒ lemma. No new certificate field is introduced — `engine` IS the
//!    routing telemetry, so the v1 and forge-tier conformance goldens stay
//!    byte-identical (the metrics are a projection, never part of the cert oracle).
//! 2. **the seven-verdict counts** — the tally over the closed forge-tier vocabulary
//!    [`crate::verdict::CertVerdict`] (the per-clause `verdict` field).
//! 3. **the TV phase split** — the contract-TV outcome split mapped to the §6
//!    taxonomy: faithful (verified faithful), syntactic (a `Skipped` clause outside
//!    the framed sublanguage), semantic (a `Divergent` lowering infidelity), and
//!    timeout (an `Unverifiable` rlimit / verus-absent run).
//!
//! ## Gates nothing (#274, `.design/forge/audit-manifest.md` REQ-10)
//!
//! The dashboard is printed by `forge audit --metrics` as an informational section
//! after the manifest. It changes no exit code and alters no verdict — like
//! the `--meaning` companion. Its output is not part of the certificate
//! `oracle_subset`, so it never perturbs a golden.
