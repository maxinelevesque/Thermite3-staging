//! `forge/src/meaning.rs` — the definition-tower budget (REQ-6c, increment 2d;
//! `.design/stage1-forge-tier.md`) and the unfolded-tower projection
//! `forge audit --meaning` pins into the certificate.
//!
//! ## Anti-Goodhart defense (c): the definition tower
//!
//! A forge-tier contract gets its *meaning* by unfolding the `spec fn`s its
//! `req`/`ens` clauses reference, which unfold the `spec fn`s *they* reference, and
//! so on — a tower of definitions. A contract can be made to "say" something while
//! hiding the claim behind a deep stack of definitions an auditor cannot read
//! through (the Goodhart move: optimize "the contract proves" by making the contract
//! unreadable). REQ-6c bounds that tower: the **Q2 default budget** is a
//! [`TOWER_DEPTH_BUDGET`] of `4` (the longest distinct-definition unfolding chain)
//! and a [`TOWER_DEFINITION_BUDGET`] of `40` (the total distinct definitions). A
//! tower deeper or wider than the budget does not certify — a refusal at certify
//! time, never a silent pass.
//!
//! ## Where the gate lives (and where it does not)
//!
//! The gate is a **certify-time gate on the discharge path** (`check.rs`, the
//! forge/Lean `--engine` route), not in `forge audit`. `forge audit`'s "gates
//! nothing" projection invariant is shipped (#274, `.design/forge/audit-manifest.md`
//! REQ-10): it re-derives no verdict and changes no exit code. `forge audit
//! --meaning` is the **read-only companion**: it prints the unfolded tower and
//! reports its budget status, but it gates nothing itself — the refusal happens at
//! certify time, and the certificate pins the unfolded-tower hash
//! ([`MeaningAudit::tower_hash`]) so a later reader can confirm the meaning that was
//! certified is the one in front of them.
//!
//! The tower is rooted at the **contract** (`req ∪ ens`): the meaning surface an
//! auditor reads. The body's own `spec fn` calls are about the implementation, not
//! the contract's claim, so they do not seed the tower (a reached `spec fn`'s own
//! `body ∪ dec` *is* followed transitively, since the definition's meaning includes
//! its body). This mirrors the existing #226 closure machinery in `check.rs`,
//! reusing its `spec fn` call collectors rather than forking a second walker.
