//! `forge/src/obligation.rs` — the backend-neutral verification obligation
//! artifact (`.design/verified/proof-backends.md` REQ-1/REQ-1.2; increment (i),
//! blocker #204).
//!
//! Today the obligation content the pipeline discharges exists only transiently,
//! materialized as Verus text (`thermite-tv/src/obligation.rs`'s
//! `equivalence_obligation` family). This module reifies that same content as a
//! prover-neutral value (see the scope note below on serialization): an
//! [`Obligation`] carries the item, its
//! obligation [`ObligationClass`], the [`ObligationRole`], the AST slice it is
//! stated over (a `thermite-syntax` node, not a Verus string), and a prover-neutral
//! [`ObligationEnv`] (the generalization of `thermite-tv`'s `ObligationFrame` —
//! AST nodes + Thermite types + coercion flags, not rendered Verus text). An
//! engine (`engine.rs`) renders it into its own input language (Verus text for the
//! Verus engine; Lean source for the future Lean engine — increment (ii)).
//!
//! The inversion (§1): the obligation stops being Verus-shaped. The
//! Verus rendering (`obligation.rs`'s `param_list`/`spec_defs`/`as nat` rewrite)
//! becomes the Verus engine's `render`, not the artifact itself.
//!
//! A note on "serializable" (REQ-1, scope). The property
//! increment (i) delivers is prover-neutrality: the artifact carries `thermite-
//! syntax` AST nodes + Thermite `Type`s + coercion flags, not any prover's rendered
//! text. The `thermite-syntax` AST does not derive `serde` in production (serde is a
//! dev-dependency there — `thermite-syntax/Cargo.toml`), and adding it is outside
//! the #204 manifest, so the artifact is a prover-neutral in-memory value
//! (`Clone + PartialEq + Eq`), not a wire-serialized one. The Verus engine consumes
//! the `&Obligation` directly and keys its evidence on the lowered source (the
//! SHIPPED `cache::cache_key` substrate — §2(d)); wire serialization of the artifact
//! is increment (ii) work, when the Lean exporter serializes a Lean theorem (a
//! string), not the raw AST. The env's prover-neutral scalar content is what the
//! engine renders; that content is inspectable and comparable here.
