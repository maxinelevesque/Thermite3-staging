//! `forge/src/mutation.rs` — §7 step 4 of the vacuity battery: mutation scoring
//! (`thermite-design.md` §7 line 224, "operator flips, off-by-ones, early
//! returns, branch swaps — fixed deterministic mutator set"). Given a `fn` whose
//! body already verifies L3, this module generates a frozen, deterministic
//! set of mutants of that body (the contract untouched), re-lowers + re-verifies
//! each against the same contract through the existing verus driver + proof
//! cache, and scores the kill ratio (`killed / scored`). A mutant verus
//! rejects is killed (the contract caught the wrong body — good); a mutant
//! verus proves is a survivor (the contract cannot tell the mutant from the
//! body — too weak). A configurable floor (default 60%, §7) gates
//! certification: below the floor the item does not certify and the surviving
//! mutants are the precise strengthening prompt.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/mutation-scoring.md`.
//!
//! ## Polarity
//!
//! A mutant is a wrong body. If verus still proves it against the
//! contract, the contract is satisfied by both the right body and the wrong one:
//! it under-specifies. So `Proved` = survived = a hole in the contract; a
//! verus failure = killed = the contract did its job (REQ-4). This is the same
//! polarity inversion #13's harnesses use, applied to the body.
