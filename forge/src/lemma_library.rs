//! `forge/src/lemma_library.rs` — the Stage-1 forge-tier **lemma library mechanics**
//! (`.design/stage1-forge-tier.md` REQ-9 / AC-13, increment 3; the last stage-1
//! feature increment). This is the logic the surface (2a's `lemma` item), the proof
//! discharge (2e's `discharge_forge_lemma`), and the frozen battery (2c's
//! `scan_citations`) set up for. REQ-9 trails usage — it is last in dependency order
//! because it reasons about ALREADY-discharged lemma certificates.
//!
//! Three mechanics, all per-project (Q1 — there is no cross-project sharing; that is
//! deferred, see the spec's Out of Scope):
//!
//! 1. **Per-project lemma namespace** (Q1). A project's top-level `lemma` items form a
//!    namespace ([`LemmaLibrary`]) keyed by name. Only a top-level [`LemmaItem`] enters
//!    the namespace — a proof-local `have`/`let` binding never does, so the namespace is
//!    the only cross-function citation surface (Q6: "no cross-function sharing except via
//!    a lemma"). A `proof for f` block's several `ens#k` obligations share that one
//!    function's local context; a name they establish locally is invisible to `proof for
//!    g` (it is not in the namespace) — enforced structurally by building the namespace
//!    from top-level lemmas only.
//!
//! 2. **Certified-only citation resolution** (AC-13). A proof citing a project lemma
//!    (`simp [melems_cons]`) resolves only if that lemma carries a certificate. A
//!    citation to a project lemma that did not certify is REFUSED — named — never a
//!    silent pass ([`enforce_citations`] → [`UncertifiedCitation`]). This is the
//!    proof-tier analogue of the frozen-battery refusal: the frozen battery refuses a
//!    citation outside the closed spine simp set; REQ-9 refuses a citation to an
//!    uncertified project lemma. The two compose — a simp citation resolves against the
//!    frozen battery OR a certified project lemma; anything else is refused.
//!
//! 3. **Dedup-on-burn by statement hash with citation rewrite** (Q1 / AC-13). Two
//!    lemmas with the same statement (same params + `req` + `ens`) under different names
//!    are one proven fact: only the first (the canonical) is stored, and a citation to
//!    the duplicate is rewritten to the canonical ([`LemmaLibrary::rewrite_citations`]).
//!    The statement hash ([`statement_hash`]) excludes the lemma NAME and the proof, so
//!    re-proving the same statement under a new name dedups to the existing lemma rather
//!    than storing a copy.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/stage1-forge-tier.md` REQ-9 / AC-13.
