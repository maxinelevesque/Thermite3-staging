//! `forge/src/vacuity_solver.rs` — the solver-backed layer of the §7 vacuity
//! battery (`thermite-design.md` §7 steps 2-3): tautology detection and
//! vacuous-precondition detection. It runs as a gate stage in `forge check`
//! after #6's structural triage (`forge/src/vacuity.rs`) returns
//! `ProceedToL3` and before the item's own L3 proof. A contract that survives the
//! syntactic checks may still be semantically degenerate:
//!
//! - a postcondition that holds for an arbitrary result (`ens result >= 0` for a
//!   `u32`) says nothing about what the function computes (a tautology);
//! - a requirement that is unsatisfiable (`req x > 5 && x < 3`) means the function
//!   can never be called and its contract is vacuously true (a vacuous
//!   precondition).
//!
//! These are the solver counterparts of #6's syntactic moves (which catch
//! `ens true` / `x == x` / `ens` literally equal to a `req` conjunct). #13 catches
//! the logical versions the syntax misses. This is the anti-Goodhart machinery
//! (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9: the §7 battery exists to catch the gaming move of a
//! logically-vacuous contract).
//!
//! Both checks reuse the existing Verus contract lowering: each builds a one-query
//! `proof fn` harness by lowering the item via `thermite_lower::lower` (so the
//! emitted `requires`/`ensures` text is byte-identical to the proof's, with
//! the combinator + `spec fn` weaving the lowerer already performs) and splicing
//! that verbatim contract into the harness frame. The harness is run through verus
//! and the verdict interpreted (REQ-3): a verus success is the bad news
//! (the contract is degenerate, so reject). A verus failure is clean. A timeout or
//! environment error is not read as either "tautology" or "clean".

/// exit path: success, a clean failure, or a `?` early-return on an environment/IO
/// error. Reuses `check.rs`'s #53 guard (the identical fix). Cleanup is
/// best-effort (`Drop` does a `let _ = remove_dir_all`), never a panic (R-CODE-2):
/// a removal failure must not mask the verus result.
