//! Divergence tests for forge's §7.1 structural vacuity triage (issue #6,
//! commit 838374d). Authored by acto-critic: each test pins a place where the
//! implementation diverges from the governing authority
//! (`.design/forge/vacuity-triage.md` + `thermite-design.md` §7.1) and fails
//! against the current toolchain.
//!
//! forge is a pure `bin` crate (no `lib.rs`), so these drive the built `forge`
//! binary (same pattern as `vacuity_slag_conformance.rs`) and assert the emitted
//! certificate's `reject.cause` / `level`. Expected values trace to the design
//! REQ wording (R-CHAR-3), not to forge's own output.
//!
//! `unwrap`/`expect` are fine here — `tests/` is not anti-pattern-gated.
