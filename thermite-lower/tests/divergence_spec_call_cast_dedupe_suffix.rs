//! Divergence pin (crosslink #231) — the #225 spec-call declared-param-type
//! narrowing is skipped when the argument's lowered text happens to end with
//! `as <cast>`, even though the whole argument is still the unbounded spec
//! `int`. The dedupe heuristic at every `spec_call_param_cast` consumer
//! (`lower_expr` `Call` arm, twice, and the c116360c `lower_inv_expr` `Call`
//! arm) is textual:
//!
//!     if lowered.ends_with(&format!("as {cast}")) { skip the cast }
//!
//! For `req s_dec(k + j as u32)` the arg lowers to `k + j as u32`; `as` binds
//! tighter than `+`, so this is `k + (j as u32)` — in Verus spec position
//! `u32 + u32` widens to `int`, the suffix check matches `as u32`, the
//! narrowing is skipped, and the emitted `s_dec(k + j as u32)` is ill-typed:
//! E0308 `expected u32, found int` → the whole item dies at L0 though the
//! Thermite source is correct (live-confirmed via `forge check`: `s_dec` L3,
//! `f` L0, E0308 on the requires line). The struct-inv twin (the c116360c
//! `Expr::Call` arm in `lower_inv_expr`) shares the heuristic verbatim and
//! emits `s_a(self.x + self.y as u32)` — same E0308 (verus-confirmed by hand).
//!
//! The authority (R-CHAR-3): `.design/lower/verus-lowering.md` REQ-5 — in spec
//! position integer arithmetic is the unbounded `int`; an arithmetic argument
//! to a user spec fn must narrow to the callee's declared param type, inner
//! parenthesized because `as` binds tighter than `+`/`-` (#122). The expected
//! emission `(k + j as u32) as u32` is hand-derived from `s_dec(n: u32)`,
//! never copied from the lowerer's output.
