//! Adversarial audit of #37 — the regression probe: lowering emits the
//! numeric `value` in the executable expression, not the verbatim `raw`.
//!
//! ast.md REQ-6 critical note: "the thermite-lower lowering … continues to
//! emit the numeric `value` (e.g. `1000000`), not the raw — so the
//! `tests/golden/lower/*.verus.rs` files do not change". This test pins that
//! invariant directly on a fresh `_`-bearing literal.
//!
//! Critic note on assertion shape: the L1 lowering also embeds the
//! verbatim clause source text inside the human-legible diagnostic label of
//! `thermite_check!("req", "x <= 1_000", x <= 1000)` — that `1_000` in the
//! string literal is the original `Clause.text`, the legible
//! diagnostic, not the executable form. The invariant is about the lowered
//! expression (`x <= 1000`), so we assert on that form, not a blanket substring.
//!
//! Expected values hand-derived from the cited REQ text — the value `1000` is
//! the `_`-stripped form of the source `1_000` (R-CHAR-3: not copied from the
//! lowerer's output). Expected to pass under a2c0f73 (documents no divergence).
