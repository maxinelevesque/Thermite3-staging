//! Regression: the cast-`<` paren discipline on the struct type-invariant
//! lowering path (blocker #148, CLOSED — this test pins the fix).
//!
//! Commit 167b9f4 first fixed `lower_binary_operand` (the fn-contract / loop-`inv`
//! path, used by `forge tv` + `forge check`'s `requires`/`ensures`/loop
//! `invariant`): a `Cast` left-operand of a `<`-leading op (`<`/`<=`/`<<`) is
//! parenthesized so `x as u32 < 33` does not mis-parse as a generic-argument
//! list (`u32<33, …>` → "expected `,`"). See `divergence_cast_paren.rs` for the
//! #122/#146 family.
//!
//! The struct type-invariant path (`lower_inv_expr` → `lower_inv_operand`, the
//! REQ-8 `well_formed()` predicate, `.design/lower/...` struct invariants) has its
//! own operand-parenthesizer, which #148 extended with the same cast-`<` guard
//! (`lower_inv_operand` in `thermite-lower/src/lower.rs`: a `Cast` left operand of
//! an `is_lt_leading` parent is parenthesized — R-DEFER-8, the convention is now
//! uniform across every emission site). So `} inv (x as u32) < cap` lowers to the
//! parse-correct `(self.x as u32) < self.cap`, not the bare `self.x as u32 <
//! self.cap` that Verus/Rust would read as `u32<…>`.
//!
//! Authority: blocker #146 / #148 (the cast-`<` paren discipline — the dual of
//! #122). R-CHAR-3: the paren'd form below is the design's parse-correct form,
//! asserted directly, not copied from the lowerer's output. This test runs in CI
//! (no `#[ignore]`) and fails if the struct-inv parenthesizer ever regresses.

/// A struct type-invariant with a cast left of `<` must lower with the cast
/// parenthesized (`(x as u32) < cap`), never the mis-parsing bare form
/// `x as u32 < cap` (which Verus/Rust reads as `u32<cap, …>` — "expected `,`").
/// This is the #146 cast-`<` fix on the struct type-invariant path it missed.
