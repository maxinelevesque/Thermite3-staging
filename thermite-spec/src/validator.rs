//! The SpecTherm validator — the boundary API that walks a parsed
//! `thermite-syntax` program's contract positions and enforces §4.2's "locked
//! cage": a contract may use only registered combinators (right name + arity +
//! arg-kinds), declared `spec fn` calls, and the built-in operators / literals /
//! paths the grammar already sanctions, and nothing else.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md` (REQ-3/4/5).
//! Verified against the oracle at `tests/golden/combinators/` (accept.json /
//! reject.json), R-CHAR-3.
